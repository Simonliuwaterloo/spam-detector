Here\\'s the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning\\nFreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my\\nwife\\'s web site with Apache server running on it and a few other\\nservices (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we\\nget a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On\\noccasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a\\nreconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in\\nwhich are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see\\nover 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an\\noccasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.\\n\\nI noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated\\nwith the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,\\nto make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor\\nfiles. So I have just added \"-home /etc/razor\" as an argument. I\\nhaven\\'t had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether\\nthis change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This\\nparagraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph\\nabove; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)\\n\\nAt any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email\\nprocessing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,\\nperhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?\\n\\nAny ideas would be welcome.\\n\\nThanks,\\nJoe\\n---\\nJoe Berry\\njoe@topshot.com\\nAIM \"joe topshot\"\\nYahoo Msgr \"joetopshot\"\\njabber \"joetopshot@topshot.com\"\\nBaltimore, MD\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\\ncell phone?

They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage\\nregulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly\\nthe energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16\\nkilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic\\nenergy, there\\'s enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in\\na vacuum.\\n\\nSuppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8\\nkw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does\\nthe 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet\\nit isn\\'t -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --\\nthe speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored\\nelectrically in the capacitor.  And it\\'s not at all obvious that the torque\\nvs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do\\nit without wheels, drive train, etc.\\n\\nBut if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!\\n\\nOn to the Lunarnationals?

It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too\\nstrong a case.  So here we Dave\\'s attempt to fool you into thinking they\\'re\\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.\\n\\nAnyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\\nway.\\n\\nYeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.\\n\\nThe truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\\n\\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public\\'s\\nperception of them?  If you haven\\'t already, contact them and ask them how\\nthey feel about this foolishness.\\n\\n\\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\nDave deflects what he can\\'t take the time to understand\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s really quite pitiful.  When normal people don\\'t understand something\\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\\nand looking like fools.\\n\\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\\n\\nPosts a link to something he doesn\\'t understand\\nGet\\'s a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\\nDerides the idea as being \\'too much trouble\\' and blogs it.\\nExpects others to do research for him\\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\\nRealizes he\\'s been a fool but refuses to correct himself\\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it\\'s use of RDF reveal this to be\\ntrue.  Dave doesn\\'t get the idea of the semantic web.  He\\'d rather have you\\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\\ntrying.\\n\\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It\\'s like that movie The\\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave\\'s like the purser ranting and raving that the\\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don\\'t know about\\nyou but I\\'d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\\nThe ship\\'s fucking sinking and I don\\'t want to be following the idiot.\"\\n\\nDave\\'s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\\naround.  You\\'re supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\\ngood ol\\' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It\\'s all about love, right?  To hell\\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.

We\\'ll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\\n\\n\\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\\n\\n\\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.\\n\\nAnother developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it\\'s fundamentally\\nimpossible:\\n\\nHis basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.\\n\\nIn the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\\npeople at other tables start whispering \"that guy is an idiot...\"\\n\\nThe zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you\\'ve got a similar\\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\\n\\n\\nIt would appear the \\'dictator release\\' strategy that Dave\\'s been trying on\\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\\n\\nI\\'m going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\\ndeal-stoppers.\\n\\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\\nit!\\n\\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They\\'re going to be\\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\\n\\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\\ngetting rejected!\\n\\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\\n\\'blame America\\' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he\\'s trying to pretend we should be\\nnice to him because he\\'s still recovering?\\n\\nUh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\\nfights.  We\\'ll still kick your ass regardless.  That\\'s what years of your\\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDave is Scary on 9/11\\n\\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\\n\\n\\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\\nI\\'ll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there\\'s\\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\\n9-11.\\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\\nsomeone who doesn\\'t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\\n\\n\\nWow, apparently Dave\\'s sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:\\n\\nThe man seems to show over and over that he\\'s nothing more than a whining\\nbuffoon\\n\\nGive that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!\\n\\nRelated links over at PhotoDude, Richard Bennett, Andrea Harris, Reid Stott,\\nJeff Jarvis, Ipse Dixit, and the Fat Guy.\\n\\n\\n 9/9/02; 12:29:45 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRSS 2.0: code name \"Hitler\"\\n\\n\\nIf Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community\\nconsensus, here now we call it the \"Hitler\" release of 2.0.\\n\\n\"No objections\"?  No, he means \"No objections I choose to hear.\"\\n\\nDave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferral log funnies\\n\\n\\nEvery now and then we check the referral logs to see what\\'s pointing back to\\nus.  We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\\n\\n\\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark \"RSS\"\\n\\n\\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.\\n\\nSo we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\\nto patent the term \\'RSS\\' back in 2000. Here\\'s the patent application:\\n\\nhttp://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336\\n\\nThis was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.\\n\\nCould Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!\\n\\nSince when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:\\n\\nTim O\\'Reilly says patents are OK, he\\'s just against stupid patents. In the\\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\\nThere\\'s no way to route around them.\\n\\n 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen\\'s a Permalink not a Permalink?\\n\\n\\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\\nnothing at that point. So apparently the \"perma-\" part in permalink is\\npermanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a\\ndefinition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n 9/2/02; 6:16:03 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This entire article could be \\nrewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. \\n\\nIf it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to \\ndesign a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might \\nlook something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: \\n\\n- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify \\nrequired elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown \\nnumber of parsers around the world. \\n- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, \\nthus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. \\n- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such \\negregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an \\nobsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. \\n- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core \\nnamespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely \\nresistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. \\n- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its \\nadd-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the \\nspec would neither define nor elaborate on. \\n- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements \\nsemantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also \\nfail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the \\nsame thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers \\nand inconsistent behavior across consumers. \\n\\nRSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. \\nFor anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's \\npretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication \\nformat, we have the worst one possible. \\n\\nExcept, of course, for all the others. \\n\\nThe problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of \\nnecessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format \\nhas, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very \\nweaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it \\npossible in the first place. \\n\\n- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened \\nup RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. \\n- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing \\ncontent and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce \\nvalid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social \\nmores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally \\nintroducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable \\ndisplay through unclosed HTML elements. \\n- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't \\nmatter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages \\nwhere handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes \\nand handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out \\nin reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more \\nflexibility. \\n\\nFurthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious \\ncomputational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type \\nDescription? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made \\nit possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this \\nease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts \\nover the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the \\nyear 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: \\n\\n- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which \\nfell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. \\n- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at \\nthe time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years \\nlater, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with \\nparsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF \\nparsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version \\nis generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) \\nMeanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts \\nrecommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to \\nactually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise \\nof better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 \\nfeed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the \\nworld&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets \\ninto a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. \\n- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been \\nhaphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be \\nflourishing. \\n\\nEvolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a \\nthousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to \\ntheir eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. \\n\\n- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. \\nMy RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a \\nTEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know \\nnothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is \\nlittered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. \\nIf everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would \\nbe trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such \\nperfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. \\nThere is no middle ground. \\n- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to \\nearlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, \\nthey are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long \\ndescriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such \\npractices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle \\nthem. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it \\nfaces. \\n- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie \\nOrgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list \\nof RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with \\nany evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS \\n0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it \\n&#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is \\nmissing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central \\ngroup can design a better system in the long haul. \\n\\nDesigned formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable \\nformats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect \\nsyndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. \\nInfrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, \\npartially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html\\n[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/467\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

That\\'s a steppe too far\\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \\n \\n \\n So you think you\\'ve got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\\n or sick of Sheffield.\\n \\n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\\n \\n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\\n with life in Blair\\'s Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\\n \\n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\\n side.\\n \\n \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet,\" said Kommersant.\\n \\n \"In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\\n becoming \\'traditionally\\' relaxed.\"\\n \\n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\\n \\n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\\n opening time in the nation\\'s vodka shops.\\n \\n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\\n \"the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\\n life.\\n \\n \"The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\\n of whisky for kopecks.\"\\n \\n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\\n halfpenny in sterling.\\n \\n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\\n diehard alcoholics.\\n \\n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\\n \\n \"For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\\n off the tails from the entire collective farm\\'s herd of cattle.\"\\n \\n One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There\\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\\n Mongolian border.\\n \\n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\\n which they would like to live.\\n \\n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known\\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists\".\\n \\n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\\n \\n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\\n \\n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\\n climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will\\n solve itself\".\\n \\n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\\n \\n \"Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\\n amongst our citizens.\"\\n \\n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\\n preferred new home.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\\n\\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\\n\\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\\n\\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\\n\\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\\n\\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\\n\\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\\n\\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\\n\\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in\\n\\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n========================================================================\\n=\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\\'s team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \\n2001, DataPower\\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99), the \\nindustry\\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n\\nToday, XG3\\x99 technology powers the industry\\'s first wire-speed XML \\nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of\\n\\nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \\nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \\nindustry-leading customers and partners.\\n\\nDataPower\\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \\nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,\\n\\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \\nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\\n\\n========================================================================\\n=\\n\\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\\n\\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer\\n\\nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\\n\\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \\nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \\nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \\nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \\nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \\nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower\\x92s Board of \\nDirectors.\\n\\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and\\n\\nsales of the company\\x92s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.\\n\\nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world\\x92s first intelligent XML \\nnetworking\\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions\\n\\nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \\nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower\\x92s solutions are based on \\nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99) technology.\\n\\n\"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \\nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \\nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \\nDataPower\\x92s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \\nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \\napplications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \\nTechnology.\\n\\n\"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that\\x92s critical to Web\\n\\nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance.\" A single\\n\\nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \\nservers\\x97breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \\nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \\naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \\nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \\ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \\nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\\n\\n\"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \\nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower\\x92s patent-pending technology addresses \\na very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael \\nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with \\nDataPower\\x92s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \\nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \\nperformance and security pitfalls.\"\\n\\n\"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly\\n\\ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \\nsecurity,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \"DataPower is on\\n\\ntheir third generation of technology.

You can have a\\nbase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base\\nimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes\\nchanges to its own \"redo\" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance\\nincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the\\ncurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.\\n\\nThis is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the\\nhoneypots mailing list)\\nhttp://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html\\n\\nCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server\\napplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,\\neven before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.\\n\\nThe physical architectures of most production client/server systems are\\nlayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server\\nrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net\\nbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one\\nof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database\\nserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one\\npartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the\\npartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from\\none boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap\\nspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.\\n\\nWhen someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that\\nshouldn\\'t be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or\\nApache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But\\nwhat if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a \"delta\" or\\n\"redo\" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the\\nredo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be\\nminimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from\\nbackup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high\\navailability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is\\nalways accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at\\nthe same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater\\nperformance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be\\napplied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions\\n(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)\\n\\nDoes anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept\\nbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don\\'t yet know?\\nI use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in\\nthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server\\nsystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and\\nnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly\\nghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or\\nno) downtime.\\n\\nThanks for any opinions,\\nBen\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In the twenty-first century, only\\n> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\\n> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\\n> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\\n> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\\n> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\\n> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\\n> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of\\n> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\\n> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\\n>\\n> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\\n> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\\n> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\\n> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\\n> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\\n> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\\n> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\\n> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\\n> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\\n> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\\n> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\\n>\\n> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\\n> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\\n> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\\n> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\\n> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\\n> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\\n> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\\n> against us.\\n>\\n> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\\n> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\\n> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\\n> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\\n> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\\n> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\\n> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\\n> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\\n> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\\n> turn.\\n>\\n> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\\n> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\\n> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\\n> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\\n> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\\n> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,\\n> contain, and curtail our enemies\\' efforts to acquire dangerous\\n> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America\\n> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\\n> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\\n> be prepared to defeat our enemies\\' plans, using the best intelligence\\n> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who\\n> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have\\n> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\\n>\\n> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic\\n> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community\\n> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the\\n> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace\\n> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world\\'s great powers\\n> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist\\n> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common\\n> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by\\n> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching\\n> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese\\n> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of\\n> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political\\n> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage\\n> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,\\n> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and\\n> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great\\n> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,\\n> trade, and cultural advancement.\\n>\\n> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend\\n> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring\\n> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to\\n> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us\\n> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our\\n> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people\\n> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and\\n> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and\\n> drug cartels within their borders.\\n>\\n> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a\\n> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free\\n> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies\\n> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual\\n> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to\\n> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.\\n> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through\\n> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,\\n> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also\\n> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of\\n> AIDS and other infectious diseases.\\n>\\n> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is\\n> guided by the conviction that all nations have important\\n> responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.\\n> Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the\\n> spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international\\n> aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For\\n> freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\\n>\\n> We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,\\n> better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply\\n> the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed\\n> to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade\\n> Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as\\n> other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment\\n> these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations\\n> are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to\\n> rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\\n>\\n> Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of\\n> every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\\n> been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the\\n> clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and\\n> it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity\\n> holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom\\'s triumph over all\\n> these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in\\n> this great mission.\\n>\\n> I. Overview of America\\'s International Strategy\\n>\\n>\\n> \"Our Nation\\'s cause has always been larger than our Nation\\'s defense. We\\n> fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors\\n> liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists\\n> and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among\\n> the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and\\n> open societies on every continent.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> West Point, New York\\n> June 1, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength\\n> and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of\\n> liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with\\n> unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great\\n> strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that\\n> favors freedom.\\n>\\n> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great\\n> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and\\n> equality.\\n>\\n> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and\\n> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and\\n> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we\\n> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by\\n> catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must\\n> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\\n>\\n> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to\\n> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,\\n> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a\\n> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our\\n> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help\\n> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to\\n> progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations\\n> with other states, and respect for human dignity.\\n>\\n> And this path is not America\\'s alone. It is open to all.\\n>\\n> To achieve these goals, the United States will:\\n>\\n> * champion aspirations for human dignity;\\n>\\n> * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent\\n> attacks against us and our friends;\\n>\\n> * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;\\n>\\n> * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our\\n> friends, with weapons of mass destruction;\\n>\\n> * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and\\n> free trade;\\n>\\n> * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building\\n> the infrastructure of democracy;\\n>\\n> * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of\\n> global power; and\\n>\\n> * transform America\\'s national security institutions to meet the\\n> challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\\n>\\n>\\n> II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\\n>\\n>\\n> \"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the\\n> language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require\\n> different methods, but not different moralities.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> West Point, New York\\n> June 1, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we\\n> stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because\\n> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation\\n> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and\\n> mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live\\n> free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be\\n> oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of\\n> the secret police.\\n>\\n> America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human\\n> dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;\\n> free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;\\n> religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\\n>\\n> These demands can be met in many ways. America\\'s constitution has served\\n> us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,\\n> facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these\\n> core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not\\n> been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and\\n> aspirations of their people.\\n>\\n> Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in\\n> our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of\\n> Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a\\n> stronger, but is a freer and more just society.\\n>\\n> Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And\\n> when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central\\n> and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When\\n> we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in\\n> the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin\\n> America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can\\n> evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all\\n> cherish.\\n>\\n> Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,\\n> the national security strategy of the United States must start from\\n> these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\\n>\\n> Our principles will guide our government\\'s decisions about international\\n> cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation\\n> of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international\\n> bodies.\\n>\\n> We will:\\n>\\n> * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of\\n> human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to\\n> advance freedom;\\n>\\n> * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who\\n> struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward\\n> democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\\n>\\n> * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key\\n> themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation\\n> from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights\\n> to move toward a better future; and\\n>\\n> * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience\\n> and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\\n>\\n>\\n> We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist\\n> it.\\n>\\n> III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent\\n> Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\\n>\\n>\\n> \"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have\\n> the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already\\n> clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been\\n> waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is\\n> peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on\\n> the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of\\n> our choosing.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\\n> September 14, 2001\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of\\n> global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or\\n> religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,\\n> politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\\n>\\n> In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a\\n> lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed\\n> within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United\\n> States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals\\n> with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who\\n> knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\\n>\\n> The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in\\n> our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly\\n> elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come\\n> through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some\\n> unseen.\\n>\\n> Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,\\n> and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to\\n> achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition\\n> forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not\\n> only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of\\n> trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South\\n> America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\\n>\\n> Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist\\n> organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,\\n> control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will\\n> have a disabling effect upon the terrorists\\' ability to plan and operate.\\n>\\n> We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a\\n> coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional\\n> campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure\\n> the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial\\n> tools necessary to finish the task.\\n>\\n> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the\\n> financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of\\n> funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who\\n> support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial\\n> system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,\\n> and prevent the movement of terrorists\\' assets through alternative\\n> financial networks.\\n>\\n> However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the\\n> cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we\\n> seek.\\n>\\n> We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\\n>\\n> * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and\\n> international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist\\n> organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of\\n> terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction\\n> (WMD) or their precursors;\\n>\\n> * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests\\n> at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it\\n> reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to\\n> enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate\\n> to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by\\n> acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing\\n> harm against our people and our country; and\\n>\\n> * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists\\n> by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign\\n> responsibilities.\\n>\\n>\\n> We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international\\n> terrorism. This includes:\\n>\\n> * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely\\n> with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are\\n> illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as\\n> slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government\\n> can condone or support and all must oppose;\\n>\\n> * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim\\n> world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote\\n> terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\\n>\\n> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by\\n> enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources\\n> on areas most at risk; and\\n>\\n> * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of\\n> information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of\\n> those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\\n>\\n>\\n> While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also\\n> strengthening America\\'s homeland security to protect against and deter\\n> attack.\\n>\\n> This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization\\n> since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council\\n> and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland\\n> Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental\\n> reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland\\n> encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public\\n> and the private sector.\\n>\\n> This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,\\n> emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with\\n> terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened\\n> to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and\\n> mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop\\n> terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\\n>\\n> While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism\\n> in today\\'s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.\\n> Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations\\n> and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where\\n> governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we\\n> will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and\\n> our allies can provide.\\n>\\n> As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work\\n> with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as\\n> non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the\\n> humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to\\n> rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,\\n> threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\\n>\\n> In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are\\n> ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom\\n> and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this\\n> conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,\\n> productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in\\n> ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\\n>\\n> IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts\\n>\\n>\\n> \"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.\\n> The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements\\n> look so small.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> Berlin, Germany\\n> May 23, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional\\n> disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In\\n> an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our\\n> alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create\\n> horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states\\n> falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to\\n> alleviate suffering and restore stability.\\n>\\n> No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --\\n> direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,\\n> and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States\\n> will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\\n>\\n> * The United States should invest time and resources into building\\n> international relationships and institutions that can help manage local\\n> crises when they emerge.\\n>\\n> * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help\\n> those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when\\n> people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\\n>\\n>\\n> Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will\\n> apply these principles:\\n>\\n> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of\\n> human suffering, because of America\\'s close relationship with the state\\n> of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region\\'s importance\\n> to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace\\n> for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed\\n> to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in\\n> peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a\\n> government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and\\n> counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all\\n> parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and\\n> comprehensive settlement to the conflict.\\n>\\n> The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank\\n> stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic\\n> development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to\\n> establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If\\n> Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront\\n> corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support\\n> for the creation of a Palestinian state.\\n>\\n> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.\\n> Permanent occupation threatens Israel\\'s identity and democracy. So the\\n> United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete\\n> steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.\\n> As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw\\n> fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent\\n> with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement\\n> activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,\\n> freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians\\n> to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial\\n> role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and\\n> Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\\n>\\n> In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India\\n> and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested\\n> time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and\\n> Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a\\n> constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With\\n> Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan\\'s\\n> choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more\\n> open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India\\'s potential to\\n> become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century\\n> and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our\\n> involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in\\n> bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan\\n> that can help defuse military confrontation.\\n>\\n> Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and\\n> respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting\\n> the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to\\n> employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its\\n> neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by\\n> Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\\n>\\n> In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with\\n> countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,\\n> Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic\\n> hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,\\n> opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as\\n> the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States\\n> (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of\\n> the entire hemisphere.\\n>\\n> Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising\\n> from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict\\n> and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and\\n> security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active\\n> strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce\\n> their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of\\n> drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs\\n> in our own country.\\n>\\n> In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist\\n> groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking\\n> activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are\\n> working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat\\n> illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective\\n> sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic\\n> security to the Colombian people.\\n>\\n> In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,\\n> and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United\\n> States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --\\n> combating global terror. American interests and American principles,\\n> therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an\\n> African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.\\n> Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa\\'s\\n> fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous\\n> borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence\\n> infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\\n>\\n> An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars\\n> spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions\\n> of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to\\n> confronting these emerging transnational threats.\\n>\\n> Africa\\'s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that\\n> focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This\\n> administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the\\n> region:\\n>\\n> * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South\\n> Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement\\n> and require focused attention;\\n>\\n> * coordination with European allies and international institutions is\\n> essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace\\n> operations; and\\n>\\n> * Africa\\'s capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations\\n> must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational\\n> threats on a sustained basis.\\n>\\n>\\n> Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the\\n> surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are\\n> conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically\\n> waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to\\n> the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a\\n> common responsibility for democratic political systems offers\\n> opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\\n>\\n> V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends\\n> with Weapons of Mass Destruction\\n>\\n>\\n> \"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and\\n> technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear\\n> weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,\\n> even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to\\n> strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and\\n> have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the\\n> capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and\\n> we will oppose them with all our power.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> West Point, New York\\n> June 1, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our\\n> allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy\\'s use of\\n> force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the\\n> collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security\\n> environment has undergone profound transformation.\\n>\\n> Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our\\n> relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the\\n> balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear\\n> arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as\\n> counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were\\n> inconceivable.\\n>\\n> But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.\\n> None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power\\n> that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and\\n> motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain\\n> destructive powers hitherto available only to the world\\'s strongest\\n> states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass\\n> destruction against us, make today\\'s security environment more complex\\n> and dangerous.\\n>\\n> In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue\\n> states that, while different in important ways, share a number of\\n> attributes. These states:\\n>\\n> * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources\\n> for the personal gain of the rulers;\\n>\\n> * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,\\n> and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\\n>\\n> * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with\\n> other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively\\n> to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\\n>\\n> * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and\\n>\\n> * reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything\\n> for which it stands.\\n>\\n>\\n> At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq\\'s\\n> designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against\\n> Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear\\n> weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become\\n> the world\\'s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested\\n> increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.\\n> Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as\\n> well. These states\\' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has\\n> become a looming threat to all nations.\\n>\\n> We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients\\n> before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction\\n> against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must\\n> take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new\\n> partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military\\n> forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective\\n> missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence\\n> collection and analysis.\\n>\\n> Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\\n>\\n> * Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend\\n> against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key\\n> capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce\\n> capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our\\n> homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated\\n> into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of\\n> our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed\\n> adversaries.\\n>\\n> * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and\\n> terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise\\n> necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,\\n> arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction\\n> assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when\\n> necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will\\n> continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their\\n> increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and\\n> threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20\\n> billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step\\n> forward.\\n>\\n> * Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD\\n> use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of\\n> WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such\\n> weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading\\n> enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States\\n> must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our\\n> forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\\n>\\n>\\n> It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of\\n> this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the\\n> United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have\\n> in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy\\n> of today\\'s threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be\\n> caused by our adversaries\\' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.\\n> We cannot let our enemies strike first.\\n>\\n> * In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we\\n> faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an\\n> effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of\\n> retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states\\n> more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and\\n> the wealth of their nations.\\n>\\n> * In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered\\n> weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who\\n> used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons\\n> of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and\\n> military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also\\n> allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our\\n> allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior\\n> of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means\\n> of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\\n>\\n> * Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a\\n> terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the\\n> targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death\\n> and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between\\n> states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to\\n> action.\\n>\\n>\\n> For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer\\n> an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves\\n> against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars\\n> and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption\\n> on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible\\n> mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\\n>\\n> We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and\\n> objectives of today\\'s adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not\\n> seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would\\n> fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use\\n> of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed\\n> and delivered covertly and without warning.\\n>\\n> The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian\\n> population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law\\n> of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,\\n> mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and\\n> these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired\\n> and used weapons of mass destruction.\\n>\\n> The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions\\n> to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the\\n> threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling\\n> the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if\\n> uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy\\'s attack. To\\n> forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United\\n> States will, if necessary, act preemptively.\\n>\\n> The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging\\n> threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.\\n> Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek\\n> the world\\'s most destructive technologies, the United States cannot\\n> remain idle while dangers gather.\\n>\\n> We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our\\n> actions. To support preemptive options, we will:\\n>\\n> * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide\\n> timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\\n>\\n> * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the\\n> most dangerous threats; and\\n>\\n> * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to\\n> conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\\n>\\n>\\n> The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat\\n> to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our\\n> actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\\n>\\n> VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and\\n> Free Trade.\\n>\\n>\\n> \"When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a\\n> privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever\\n> enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in\\n> better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade\\n> revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> Monterrey, Mexico\\n> March 22, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing\\n> prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth\\n> supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher\\n> incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs\\n> economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it\\n> reinforces the habits of liberty.\\n>\\n> We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America\\'s\\n> shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic\\n> policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our\\n> economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of\\n> policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic\\n> growth, including:\\n>\\n> * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business\\n> investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\\n>\\n> * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that\\n> improve incentives for work and investment;\\n>\\n> * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are\\n> confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic\\n> endeavors;\\n>\\n> * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most\\n> efficient use;\\n>\\n> * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;\\n>\\n> * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and\\n> skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\\n>\\n> * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the\\n> diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and\\n> opportunity.\\n>\\n>\\n> The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not\\n> command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the\\n> best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further\\n> strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for\\n> all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the\\n> developing world.\\n>\\n> A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.\\n> national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies\\n> for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake\\n> of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in\\n> their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are\\n> Japan\\'s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of\\n> non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to\\n> use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --\\n> including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they\\n> are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher\\n> global economic growth.\\n>\\n> Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic\\n> growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand\\n> the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging\\n> markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise\\n> living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a\\n> world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that\\n> allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in\\n> their future.\\n>\\n> We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve\\n> access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will\\n> continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial\\n> markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International\\n> Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action\\n> Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and\\n> more effectively resolving them when they occur.\\n>\\n> The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from\\n> occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing\\n> so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy\\n> conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on\\n> achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,\\n> exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\\n>\\n> The concept of \"free trade\" arose as a moral principle even before it\\n> became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others\\n> value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something\\n> that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the\\n> freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free\\n> trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\\n>\\n> * Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we\\n> helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,\\n> especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for\\n> completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the\\n> accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade\\n> Organization. We will assist Russia\\'s preparations to join the WTO.\\n>\\n> * Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies\\n> in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of\\n> the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United\\n> States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,\\n> targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and\\n> government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the\\n> poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences\\n> allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free\\n> trade.\\n>\\n> * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the\\n> free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration\\n> will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and\\n> Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of\\n> developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.\\n> Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will\\n> be our principal focal points.\\n>\\n> * Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every\\n> administration\\'s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with\\n> Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished\\n> majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing\\n> Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for\\n> developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will\\n> work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade\\n> agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade\\n> Promotion Authority.\\n>\\n> * Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade\\n> policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,\\n> competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open\\n> societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional\\n> integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in\\n> developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa\\n> Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods\\n> produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more\\n> use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue\\n> to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer\\n> countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access,\\n> the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public\\n> health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are\\n> flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical\\n> medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and\\n> malaria.\\n>\\n> * Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.\\n> Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on\\n> enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing\\n> disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a\\n> global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations\\n> that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws\\n> against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international\\n> community must be able to address genuine concerns about government\\n> subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which\\n> undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\\n>\\n> * Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound\\n> statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used\\n> in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the\\n> American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the\\n> enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that\\n> the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American\\n> workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the\\n> change and dynamism of open markets.\\n>\\n> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster\\n> economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with\\n> widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental\\n> concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy \"network\"\\n> between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the\\n> International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade\\n> talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\\n>\\n> * Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security\\n> and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our\\n> allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and\\n> types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere,\\n> Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to\\n> work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient\\n> technologies.\\n>\\n>\\n> Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize\\n> greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing\\n> them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the\\n> global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America\\'s greenhouse\\n> gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such\\n> emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10\\n> years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be\\n> to:\\n>\\n> * remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for\\n> international cooperation;\\n>\\n> * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of\\n> the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to\\n> companies that can show real cuts;\\n>\\n> * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission\\n> reductions;\\n>\\n> * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as\\n> well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,\\n> while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\\n>\\n> * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to\\n> a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change\\n> by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year\\'s\\n> budget; and\\n>\\n> * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas\\n> emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and\\n> resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and\\n> better path.\\n>\\n>\\n> VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building\\n> the Infrastructure of Democracy\\n>\\n>\\n> \"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to\\n> rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we\\n> must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> Washington, D.C. (Inter-American\\n> Development Bank)\\n> March 14, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human\\n> race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including\\n> all of the world\\'s poor in an expanding circle of development -- and\\n> opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of\\n> U.S. international policy.\\n>\\n> Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic\\n> growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served\\n> to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and\\n> perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars\\n> spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction\\n> achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\\n>\\n> Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this\\n> failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing\\n> for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and\\n> the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\\n>\\n> This Administration\\'s goal is to help unleash the productive potential\\n> of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is\\n> impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have\\n> implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels\\n> of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should\\n> set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world\\'s\\n> poorest economies within a decade.\\n>\\n> The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to\\n> achieve this goal:\\n>\\n> * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of\\n> national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core\\n> development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our\\n> present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,\\n> these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge\\n> Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest\\n> in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight\\n> corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest\\n> in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and\\n> enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward\\n> countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those\\n> that have not to implement reforms.\\n>\\n> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development\\n> banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a\\n> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other\\n> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of\\n> the world\\'s poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.\\n> contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.\\n> contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the\\n> World Bank\\'s fund for the poorest countries -- and the African\\n> Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing\\n> poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially\\n> in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral\\n> development banks to focus on activities that increase economic\\n> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,\\n> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant\\n> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in\\n> developing countries.\\n>\\n> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development\\n> assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world\\'s\\n> poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that\\n> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to\\n> health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a\\n> better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure\\n> the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering\\n> results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own\\n> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral\\n> development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for\\n> achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\\n> replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation\\n> system that measures recipient countries\\' progress. For the first time,\\n> donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the\\n> achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.\\n> contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the\\n> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this\\n> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything\\n> that these institutions do.\\n>\\n> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\\n> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants\\n> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\\n> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\\n> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\\n> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the\\n> poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,\\n> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress\\n> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development\\n> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private\\n> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support\\n> development projects that show results.\\n>\\n> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are\\n> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,\\n> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and\\n> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows\\n> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national\\n> security strategy.\\n>\\n> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor\\n> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics\\n> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be\\n> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the\\n> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest\\n> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective\\n> local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new\\n> global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan\\n> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\\n> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than\\n> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the\\n> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\\n>\\n> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of\\n> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources\\n> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States\\n> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\\n> percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher\\n> training in Africa. The United States can also bring information\\n> technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been\\n> devastated by AIDS.\\n>\\n> * Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies,\\n> including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields\\n> in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.\\n> Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits\\n> to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still\\n> suffer from hunger and malnutrition.\\n>\\n>\\n> VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers\\n> of Global Power\\n>\\n>\\n> \"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th\\n> century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead\\n> of prepare for war.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> West Point, New York\\n> June 1, 2002\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as\\n> broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance\\n> of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires\\n> clear priorities, an appreciation of others\\' interests, and consistent\\n> consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.\\n>\\n> There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can\\n> accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies\\n> and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the\\n> strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the\\n> North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its\\n> inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European\\n> security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world\\n> trade.\\n>\\n> The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself\\n> recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the\\n> first time. NATO\\'s core mission -- collective defense of the\\n> transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop\\n> new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new\\n> circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice,\\n> highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to\\n> respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\\n>\\n> The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,\\n> creating coalitions under NATO\\'s own mandate, as well as contributing to\\n> mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\\n>\\n> * expand NATO\\'s membership to those democratic nations willing and\\n> able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\\n>\\n> * ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate\\n> combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\\n>\\n> * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become\\n> effective multinational fighting forces;\\n>\\n> * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of\\n> scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that\\n> they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\\n>\\n> * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to\\n> meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of\\n> training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;\\n> and\\n>\\n> * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as\\n> we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\\n>\\n>\\n> If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a\\n> partnership as central to the security and interests of its member\\n> states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common\\n> perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to\\n> take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the\\n> same time, we welcome our European allies\\' efforts to forge a greater\\n> foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to\\n> close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We\\n> cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of\\n> transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\\n>\\n> The attacks of September 11 energized America\\'s Asian alliances.\\n> Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an\\n> attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the\\n> dispatch of some of the world\\'s finest combat forces for Operation\\n> Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented\\n> levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist\\n> attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our\\n> alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received\\n> invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\\n>\\n> The war against terrorism has proven that America\\'s alliances in Asia\\n> not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and\\n> ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and\\n> friendships, we will:\\n>\\n>\\n> * look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and\\n> global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our\\n> close defense and diplomatic cooperation;\\n>\\n> * work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while\\n> preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of\\n> the region over the longer-term;\\n>\\n> * build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we\\n> continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as\\n> we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\\n>\\n> * maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our\\n> allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic\\n> environment; and\\n>\\n> * build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with\\n> institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\\n> forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage\\n> change in this dynamic region.\\n>\\n>\\n> We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power\\n> competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of\\n> internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all\\n> three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly\\n> global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\\n>\\n> With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based\\n> on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and\\n> Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on\\n> Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a\\n> critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,\\n> long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United\\n> States. Russia\\'s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their\\n> country\\'s current weakness and the policies -- internal and external --\\n> needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that\\n> Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that\\n> Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.\\n>\\n> United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to\\n> refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and\\n> challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the\\n> global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia\\'s entry into the\\n> World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to\\n> promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have\\n> created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security\\n> cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will\\n> continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the\\n> former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable\\n> neighborhood will reinforce Russia\\'s growing commitment to integration\\n> into the Euro-Atlantic community.\\n>\\n> At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still\\n> divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to\\n> build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our\\n> motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our\\n> relations. Russia\\'s uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market\\n> democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons\\n> of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia\\'s very\\n> weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those\\n> opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even\\n> decades.\\n>\\n> The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral\\n> relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests\\n> require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest\\n> democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative\\n> government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We\\n> have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through\\n> the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest\\n> in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.\\n>\\n> Differences remain, including over the development of India\\'s nuclear\\n> and missile programs, and the pace of India\\'s economic reforms. But\\n> while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about\\n> India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with\\n> which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership\\n> with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic\\n> future.\\n>\\n> The United States relationship with China is an important part of our\\n> strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific\\n> region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous\\n> China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future.\\n> Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst\\n> features of the Communist legacy, China\\'s leaders have not yet made the\\n> next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.\\n> In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its\\n> neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated\\n> path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national\\n> greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is\\n> the only source of that greatness.\\n>\\n> The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing\\n> China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including\\n> the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean\\n> peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan\\n> and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and\\n> similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats,\\n> such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the\\n> welfare of our citizens.\\n>\\n> Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become\\n> more open with information, promote the development of civil society,\\n> and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to\\n> political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting\\n> village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national\\n> one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly\\n> accountable to its citizen\\'s needs and aspirations, however, much work\\n> remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think,\\n> assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.\\n>\\n> Our important trade relationship will benefit from China\\'s entry into\\n> the World Trade Organization, which will create more export\\n> opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers,\\n> and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over\\n> $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and\\n> the WTO\\'s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance\\n> openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic\\n> protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other\\n> areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the\\n> self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human\\n> rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation\\n> commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but\\n> not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.\\n>\\n> The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for\\n> relations between the United States and other main centers of global\\n> power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies\\n> in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we\\n> must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships\\n> become routine and unproductive.\\n>\\n> Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We\\n> can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober\\n> analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices\\n> that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open\\n> the path of progress.\\n>\\n> IX. Transform America\\'s National Security Institutions to Meet the\\n> Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century\\n>\\n>\\n> \"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch\\n> its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity,\\n> and enterprise of our people.\"\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> President Bush\\n> Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)\\n> September 20, 2001\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n> The major institutions of American national security were designed in a\\n> different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be\\n> transformed.\\n>\\n> It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength.\\n> We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military\\'s\\n> highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively,\\n> our military must:\\n>\\n> * assure our allies and friends;\\n>\\n> * dissuade future military competition;\\n>\\n> * deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and\\n>\\n> * decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.\\n>\\n>\\n> The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their\\n> forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world\\'s most\\n> strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must\\n> confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to\\n> deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on\\n> how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might\\n> occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational\\n> challenges.\\n>\\n> The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound\\n> symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our\\n> willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,\\n> the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of\\n> power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the\\n> many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases\\n> and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as\\n> well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment\\n> of U.S. forces.\\n>\\n> Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major\\n> planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate\\n> across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch\\n> of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by\\n> developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision\\n> strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.\\n> This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the\\n> ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure\\n> U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S.\\n> infrastructure and assets in outer space.\\n>\\n> Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new\\n> approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S.\\n> intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and\\n> technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is\\n> run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.\\n> Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight\\n> the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a\\n> wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of\\n> coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.\\n>\\n> We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from\\n> experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must\\n> and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --\\n> whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United\\n> States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces\\n> sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces\\n> will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a\\n> military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the\\n> United States.\\n>\\n> Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense\\n> against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed\\n> around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,\\n> fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping\\n> with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of\\n> targets.\\n>\\n> We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to\\n> keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be\\n> appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems\\n> and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the\\n> capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the\\n> knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek\\n> the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and\\n> to maximize injury.\\n>\\n> We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide\\n> integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since\\n> the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted\\n> inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of\\n> information between intelligence and law enforcement.\\n>\\n> Initiatives in this area will include:\\n>\\n> * strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence\\n> to lead the development and actions of the Nation\\'s foreign intelligence\\n> capabilities;\\n>\\n> * establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides\\n> seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing\\n> the nation and our allies;\\n>\\n> * continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to\\n> sustain our intelligence advantage;\\n>\\n> * investing in future capabilities while working to protect them\\n> through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence\\n> capabilities; and\\n>\\n> * collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the\\n> government with all-source analysis.\\n>\\n>\\n> As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend\\n> America\\'s interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other\\n> nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding\\n> sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State\\n> Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with\\n> other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must\\n> be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations\\n> and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in\\n> international politics must also extend their reach to understand\\n> complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public\\n> health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.\\n>\\n> Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil\\n> wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief\\n> requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build\\n> police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial\\n> government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international\\n> cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American\\n> readiness to play our part.\\n>\\n> Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out\\n> to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to\\n> public information efforts that can help people around the world learn\\n> about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of\\n> civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,\\n> a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas\\n> and this is an area where America must excel.\\n>\\n> We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet\\n> our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired\\n> by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the\\n> International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend\\n> to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with\\n> other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and\\n> cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral\\n> agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will\\n> implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose\\n> provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S.\\n> personnel and officials.\\n>\\n> We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the\\n> right level and allocation of government spending on national security.\\n> The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this\\n> war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for\\n> the American people.\\n>\\n> Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is\\n> diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America\\'s borders have\\n> a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas,\\n> and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish --\\n> our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are\\n> vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we\\n> bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks.\\n> As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that\\n> until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This\\n> is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite\\n> of it.\\n>\\n> In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and\\n> interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act\\n> apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we\\n> disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for\\n> our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow\\n> such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with\\n> our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.\\n>\\n> Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the\\n> skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of\\n> our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,\\n> entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that\\n> energy. That is where our national security begins.\\n>\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\\n  broader management. International Business Machines Corp\\'s project eLiza is working\\n  to make computers \"self-healing\" when systems break.\\n\\n  \"Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\\n  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don\\'t think about what box\\n  it is running on,\" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\\n  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \\n\\n  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\\n  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\\n  needed. \\n  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\\n  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\\n  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\\n  different vendors to interoperate closely. \\n  Sun promised to deliver a \"virtualization engine\" that would let administrators look at\\n  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\\n  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \\n\\n  \"It\\'ll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,\" promised MacKay\\n  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\\n  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \\n  Finally, in 2004, Sun\\'s software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\\n  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response\\n  time for priority users, the company said.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

What would later come to be called South\\nAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the\\neast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast\\n-- which no European was known to have seen.\\nThe ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of\\nmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right\\ngeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed\\nalong its top.\\nThe shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the\\ncurvature of the Earth.\\nIt is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12\\nlarge printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was\\npublished six years before Vasco Balboa\\'s 1513 trip across the Isthmus of\\nPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan\\'s 1519-22 trip around the\\nworld.\\nDid someone get there earlier?\\n...\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\\nsources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\\nAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\\n\\nThe EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government\\'s\\npush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\\nand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\\nexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\\nanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\\nrisk to humans.\\n\\n\"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\\nexposure levels\" as well, the report said. \"The potential human health\\neffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\\nuncertainties are involved.\"\\n\\nThe report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\\nworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\\nsignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\\nemissions under the Clean Air Act.\\n\\nSome environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\\nadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\\nwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\\nseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\\n\\nEPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\\nthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\\nthe EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\\nthe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\\nmeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\\n\\nThe engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\\nalthough the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\\nis expected to produce pollution reductions.\\n\\nThe EPA\\'s 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\\nprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\\ndiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\\ngauging pollution health concerns.\\n\\nBut in this case, the report said, \"the exposure-response data are\\nconsidered too uncertain\" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\\ncancer risk to an individual.\\n\\nNevertheless, said the report, the \"totality of evidence from human, animal\\nand other supporting studies\" suggests that diesel exhaust \"is likely to be\\ncarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\\nenvironmental exposure.\"\\n\\nThe report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\\nshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\\n\"chronic respiratory hazard to humans\" contributing to increased asthma and\\nother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\\nas much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\\nto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\\ndiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\\nexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\\nsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\\n\\nEmily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\\nenvironmental organization, said: \"To reduce the public\\'s exposure to\\nharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\\nclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\\nstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment.\"\\n\\nAllen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\\nForum, said the EPA\\'s report \"focused on the past,\" whereas \"the future is\\nclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times\\ncleaner than just a dozen years ago.\"\\n\\nThe report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in\\nthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow\\nturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

New York is a bustling commercial city\\nand that\\'s the beauty of it, it\\'s a city of young\\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\\ntowers, and it\\'s not a memorializing city. Historic\\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\\nhistorical museums and in New York there\\'s barely a\\nlittle plaque. That\\'s a great thing, in my estimation.\\nIt\\'s a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant\\'s\\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant\\'s Tomb\\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It is first recorded as being used by Captain \\n> Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: \"I won\\'t thrash you Tom. \\n> Shiver my timbers if I do\".\\n\\nIt seems implausible to me that \"shiver\" here means \"to shake\"; I don\\'t\\nrecall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913\\nlists that sense as \"v. i.\", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of\\n\"shiver\", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the\\n1800s (web1913 doesn\\'t even list it as archaic or obsolete), means\\n\"to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow\".\\n\\nShivering a boat\\'s timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.\\n(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,\\nleaves you with a sinking boat.)\\n\\nSo, \"Shiver my timbers if I do,\" can be reasonably interpreted as a more\\nvivid way of saying, \"May I die suddenly if I do.\"  The interpretation\\nsuggested by Quinion, \"May my boat be damaged,\" neither makes as much\\nsense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.\\n\\nI\\'ve sent a copy of this to Quinion.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The written words are then translated\\ninto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. \\n\\n\"It went reasonably well half the time,\" said Mr Frederking, though it was\\nslow in translating phrases. \\n\\nThe research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the\\nfield. \\n\\nBut they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to\\nwork with further research and development. \\n\\nThe Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between\\nthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon\\nUniversity. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\\n> are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\\n> increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\\n> preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\\n> of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\\n> correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\\n> causative.\\n\\nBased on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation\\nbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn\\'t always appear to\\nbe causal.\\n\\n> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\\n> point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\\n> regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.\\n\\nAlso correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.\\n\\n> As it\\n> happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\\n> cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.\\n\\nNot correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and\\n<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2\\nconcentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded\\nvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing\\nat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the\\nVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn\\'t capable of such fine\\nresolution).\\n\\n> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,\\n\\nNo, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:\\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm\\n(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\").\\n\\nNot only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok\\nrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.\\nThere is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for\\nanthropogenic input. You\\'re really out on the fringe if you\\'re debating\\nthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.\\n\\n> but it looks a lot like we\\n> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\\n> record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\\n> concentrations.\\n\\nWrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past\\n400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly\\nspike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the\\nspike might not show up in the ice cores).\\n\\nStill, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that\\neven you would have a hard time arguing away.\\n\\n> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\\n> affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\\n> predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\\n> feedback systems mentioned above.\\n\\nYes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a\\nfinite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn\\'t increase,\\nbut we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be\\nenormous.\\n\\n> Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn\\'t particularly potent, although it\\n> makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\\n> methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\\n> basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\\n> that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\\n> biosphere.\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nData on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:\\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm\\n\\nNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial\\nlevels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also\\na contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly\\nanthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I\\'m in favor of reductions in\\nmethane levels as well.\\n\\nData on water vapor here:\\nhttp://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html\\n\\n> CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\\n> studies and data I\\'ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\\n> passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.\\n\\nI tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in\\nreducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,\\nwind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources\\nof C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense\\n(burying trees deep underground, for example).

I say \\nhalf-hearted because I\\'m still application-centric, and I don\\'t go as far with \\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don\\'t use the desktop at all (never have, \\non any system), and I don\\'t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\ncommon programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS \\nhome\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\nbut in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \\n\"$ Explorer work\", \"% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in \\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\nfirst letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \\n\"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other \\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it\\'s probably a sign of a \\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I\\'m done using them \\n(mostly because my laptop doesn\\'t have a lot of memory). \\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\nbash, which I don\\'t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don\\'t let the system position the \\nwindow. \\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search \\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\nthat\\'s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\nin a single directory (d:\\\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin\\'s bash shell \\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for \\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\nI don\\'t use Windows\\' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\nmy D drive I have d:\\\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \\nHOME environment variable), d:\\\\work (contains directories for each work \\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\nall programs that download things), and d:\\\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\ncreated CVS projects).

Those who deny such a watershed event take a\\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\\n\\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans \\x97 all seen live in real\\ntime by millions the world over \\x97 tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\\ndealt in icons \\x97 the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\\nrepugnant \\x97 and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\\nghoulish not fearsome.\\n\\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\\nthem both vile and yet banal \\x97 and so is confident and eager to eradicate\\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\\nparadise on earth.\\n\\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters \\x97\\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\\nthe problems inherent in \"the European way\" became all too apparent:\\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\\nhobbits after September 11.\\n\\nAmerica learned that \"moderate\" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\\nmeans nothing special to an American \\x97 at least not proof of being any more\\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases \\x97 like NATO \\x97 belongs to a\\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles \\x97 and as likely to come\\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\\noffer more long-term hope than \"stable regimes\" like the Saudis; governments\\nthat hate us have populations that like us \\x97 and vice versa; the Saudi royal\\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\\n\\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq \"chicken\\nhawks\" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan\\'s shrillness\\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\\nended than resonant of Patton\\'s audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\\ngeneration of Americans in the present military \\x97 other than a few thousand\\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama \\x97 who have been in\\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\\n\\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\\nharm\\'s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\\nthousands in high-rises.\\n\\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\\nso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.\\n\\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\\nidealism \\x97 with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\\n\\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\\nsubsequent terrible year \\x97 and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Used as part of a storage area network (define),\\nvirtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices\\ninto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that\\nis managed from a central console.\\n\\nThough major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes\\nof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after\\nscouting some 65 companies.\\n\\nMark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com\\nthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible\\nacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of\\nstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such\\nas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.\\n\\n\"This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7\\nor 8 system-level players,\" Lovington said. \"Sun sees this acquisition as a\\ncritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.\"\\n\\nN1 is Sun\\'s hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)\\narchitecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a\\nrole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled\\nas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and\\nnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.\\n\\nWhile lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground\\nin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,\\naccording to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of\\nIDC\\'s Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest\\nincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,\\nrespectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of\\n$411 million.\\n\\nSun\\'s acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of\\nSun\\'s 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: \\nhuge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; \\nand unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to \\nfailure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.\\n\\nThe MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into \"near-line\" \\narchive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive \\narchitectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including \\nexecutive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be \\nrecovered on demand.\\n\\nThese new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the \\nstorage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, \\nthese files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced \\nstarting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor\\'s MaXLine family offers \\nhigh capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between \\ntraditional ATA and SCSI drives.\\n\\nFor system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, \\neasy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server \\nenvironments.\\n\\n\"The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies \\nare meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, \\nfinancial documents and transaction records,\" said Mike Dooley, senior \\ndirector of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. \"Users may \\nnot need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but \\nwhen they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA \\ntechnology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our \\nlegacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA \\nhard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these \\nenterprise applications.\"\\n\\nThe MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage \\ndensity than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been \\ntested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, \\nalready exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, \\nwhich exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a \\nthree-year warranty.\\n\\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM \\nUltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. \\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation \\nserial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum \\ndata transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace \\nwith the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive \\nenvironments and enterprise applications.\\n\\nWith a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for \\nmanaging hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA \\nadvances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. \\nThe interface\\'s reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn \\nallows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with \\nincreased design flexibility and hot plug capability.\\n\\n\"Maxtor\\'s MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that \\nhas previously been too expensive to keep on disk,\" said Dave Reinsel, \\nanalyst at IDC. \"The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and \\nwhen integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling \\ncost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have \\nbeen the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.\"\\n\\nAvailability\\nLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine \\nII and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in \\nthe fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus \\nII with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments \\nscheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.\\n\\nAbout Maxtor\\nMaxtor Corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world\\'s leading suppliers \\nof information storage solutions.

A proposed law based on the discussion \\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\nearly 2003.\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \\nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \\nCouncil of Europe\\'s cybercrime treaty \\n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \\nprocess of considering.\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \\npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \\nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \\nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \\nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\\n\\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \\nEurope, and representatives from both countries\\' police agencies have \\nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \\ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \\nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \\nor ratified, the treaty.\\n\\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \\nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \\njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \\nweak.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\\'ve given for all the \\nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \\nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\\'s not a particularly convincing \\nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \\nmake that case.\"\\n\\nGeist added that \"there\\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \\npowers) are needed. I don\\'t know that there have been a significant \\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \\norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \\n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \\napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\\n\\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \\nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \\ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \\nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \\nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\\n\\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \\n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \\nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \\nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \\njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \\nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \\n<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> \\nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \\ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\\n\\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \\nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \\npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \\nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \\nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \\nthe draft says.\\n\\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \\nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\\n\\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\\'re allowed to use anonymous \\nmobile phones or whether you\\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \\nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\\n\\nA representative for George Radwanski \\n<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada\\'s privacy commissioner, said \\nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \\nthe paper as it stands.\"\\n\\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \\n<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The routine daily \\nkillings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in \\nNellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring \\nvillage . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the \\nhorrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi\\'s assassination: \\nThey bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in \\nevidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in \\nkerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or \\nsmothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length \\nof wood.\\n\\nI say \"our\" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves \\nIndia deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is \\npotentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India\\'s \\nstrengths, then India\\'s sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? \\nGood. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India \\nundergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a \\ndecade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed \\nor disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men\\'s \\nunwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to \\nreligion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to \\nthe same sentiments as the nation in general.\\n\\nMeanwhile, India\\'s political masters have been tut-tutting and offering \\nthe usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. \\n(It has escaped nobody\\'s notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya \\nJanata Party (BJP), or Indian People\\'s Party, and the Hindu extremists \\nof the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister \\norganizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some \\ninternational commentators, such as Britain\\'s Independent newspaper, \\nurge us to \"beware excess pessimism.\"\\n\\nThe horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we\\'re used \\nto it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That\\'s how life is, \\nfolks. Most of the time India is the world\\'s largest secular democracy; \\nand if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we \\nmustn\\'t let that distort the picture.\\n\\nOf course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, \\nwhen a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which \\nthey claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu \\nfanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some \\nMuslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the \\ntrain-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes \\nof the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the \\npartition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists\\' hands.\\n\\nThe VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and \\ninsufficient radicalism of India\\'s BJP government. Prime Minister Atal \\nBihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a \\ncoalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP\\'s \\nmore extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. \\nBut it isn\\'t working anymore. In state elections across the country, the \\nBJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP \\nfirebrands. Why put up with the government\\'s betrayal of their fascistic \\nagenda when that betrayal doesn\\'t even result in electoral success?\\n\\nThe electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark \\nthat lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the \\nsite of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that\\'s where the Godhra dead \\nwere coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, \\ntragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee \\nhas insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and \\nwrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.\\n\\nThe distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India\\'s \\npresident, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP \\nhard-liner) as well as the central government for doing \"too little too \\nlate.\" She pins the blame firmly on the \"motivated, well-planned out and \\nprovocative actions\" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the \\nNobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the \\nviolence erupted, denounced India\\'s Muslims en masse and praised the \\nnationalist movement.\\n\\nThe murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in \\nher letter demands \"stern legal action\" against them. But the VHP is \\ndetermined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such \\npublic pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting \\nthem, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces \\nthe Nobel award.\\n\\nThe political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there\\'s \\nsomething beneath it, something we don\\'t want to look in the face: \\nnamely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is \\nthe poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no \\nexcuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in \\nthe fashionable language of \"respect.\" What is there to respect in any \\nof this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around \\nthe world in religion\\'s dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, \\nreligion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And \\nwhen we\\'ve done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results \\nmakes it easier to do it again.\\n\\nSo India\\'s problem turns out to be the world\\'s problem. What happened in \\nIndia has happened in God\\'s name. The problem\\'s name is God.\\n\\nSalman Rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay \\ncollection \"Step Across This Line.\"\\n\\n© 2002 The Washington Post Company\\n\\n\\nsdw\\n\\n-- \\nsdw@lig.net http://sdw.st\\nStephen D.

A proposed law based on the discussion \\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\nearly 2003.\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \\nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \\nCouncil of Europe\\'s cybercrime treaty \\n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \\nprocess of considering.\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \\npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \\nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \\nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \\nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\\n\\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \\nEurope, and representatives from both countries\\' police agencies have \\nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \\ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \\nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \\nor ratified, the treaty.\\n\\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \\nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \\njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \\nweak.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\\'ve given for all the \\nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \\nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\\'s not a particularly convincing \\nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \\nmake that case.\"\\n\\nGeist added that \"there\\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \\npowers) are needed. I don\\'t know that there have been a significant \\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \\norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \\n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \\napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\\n\\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \\nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \\ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \\nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \\nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\\n\\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \\n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \\nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \\nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \\njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \\nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \\n<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> \\nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \\ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\\n\\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \\nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \\npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \\nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \\nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \\nthe draft says.\\n\\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \\nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\\n\\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\\'re allowed to use anonymous \\nmobile phones or whether you\\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \\nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\\n\\nA representative for George Radwanski \\n<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada\\'s privacy commissioner, said \\nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \\nthe paper as it stands.\"\\n\\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \\n<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently\\nbeen used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some\\npretty strong competition to commercial systems:\\n- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content\\nmanagement framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS\\n- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.example.com/software/ccm/cms/\\n- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.org\\n\\nThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source\\nstrength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement\\ntowards improving that situation.\\n\\nI was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for\\ngranted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it\\njust as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore\\nXML almost completely. \\n\\nI attended realizing that \"content management\" is generally used to\\napply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how\\ncompletely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration\\nof the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the\\noccasional \"...and you can use FOP to make PDF\" as if that was\\nfunctional): this seems more the case in open source content management\\nthan in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to\\nignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).\\n\\nThe honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of\\ncurrent tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I\\'d written\\ndown what he said, something like \"it sucks so extremely, it sucks so\\nwidely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is\\nno hope.\" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial\\nsystems scaled so well that the commercial \"big boys\" were really much\\nmore functional than open source, until someone pointed out, \"OK, take\\nsome average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it\\'ll scale\\npretty well.\" Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): \"content management\\nproblems are either trivial or impossible.\"\\n\\nMac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3\\neach of Mac, Linux, Windows.\\n\\nI am sure it wasn\\'t news to Jim, but I can\\'t wait to try Subversion, a\\nCVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:\\nhttp://subversion.tigris.org/\\n\\nI\\'m also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home\\nsafely, they said they\\'d only been in America four days but were already\\nhomeless...\\n\\nMax\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,\\nobviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do\\ndirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with\\ngovernment \"advisors\" along for the mission).  I\\'ve always wondered what\\nthe deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that\\nwe\\'ve acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders\\nagainst their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and\\nin recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the\\nmilitary specifically because of the circumstances of some of these\\nmissions while they were posted for that duty. I\\'m certainly glad I was\\nnever assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of\\ncovert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.\\n\\nRegardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created\\nmeaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion\\nunder any other guise.\\n\\n \\n> A lot of the current EU - US issues can be explained by this difference \\n> of perception, such as the current American unilateralism (nobody wants \\n> to help us!), the American arrogance towards Europe (they don\\'t want to \\n> do anything, so why should we ask them?) and the growing rejection of the \\n> American policy in Europe (they want to abolish the law!).\\n\\n\\nEurope is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems\\nthe US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill\\nfaster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the\\nEuropean way of doing things is beyond me.\\n\\nThe US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack\\nfor medical advice.  I really don\\'t see what is wrong with \"unilateral\"\\nanyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?\\nI hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see\\ncoming from Europe doesn\\'t actually represent the views of Europeans. \\n\\nFor various reasons I\\'m not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,\\nbut the premises of the argument against them here are lame.\\n\\n\\n> My personal point is that few Americans (percentage of overall population)\\n> have ever left their country, while even German construction workers\\n> regularly spend their holidays in Spain. So I\\'m not surprised that\\n> paranoia is growing.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast\\nmajority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the\\ncountry at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled\\nanywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. \\nDespite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of\\nthe universe.  I\\'ll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider\\nEurope to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But\\nfrom the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this\\nway?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the\\nyears.\\n\\nI love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.\\n\\nFirst, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and\\nculturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout\\nNorth America knows this isn\\'t true; there are more than five major and\\nvery distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the\\nhundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly\\nforeign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with\\nhaving the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally\\nidentical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A\\nWyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with\\nyour average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same\\nlanguage and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a\\nwildly different culture for the holidays, I\\'ll go to Oakland, New\\nOrleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live\\nthan some countries I\\'ve traveled to.  And a lot of these places are\\nfarther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.\\n\\nSecond, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a\\nneighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? \\nIn fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your\\nGerman construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,\\nonly then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous\\nsuperiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?\\n\\nIn truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the\\nUS.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with\\nrelatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very\\nsimilar to the US.

The clues below are *loaded* with snippets unique to HTML (like \\'<br>\\').\\n\\nI *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01\\nclues.  But that\\'s wrong too!  It looks I haven\\'t grokked this part of\\nyour code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the\\nclassifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,\\nand no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for\\nclues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren\\'t\\nexactly 0.5?\\n\\n> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!\\n\\nThis happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few\\nsimilar ones.  I wonder if there\\'s anything we can learn from looking\\nat the clues and the HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in\\nthe sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of \"OO and\\nsoft coding\" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including\\nZope and ZEO).\\n\\n> That there are *any* 0.50 clues in here means the scheme ran out of\\n> anything interesting to look at.

I *hoped* I was using a snapshot\\nof only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002),\\nbut turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward is\\ncurrently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a\\nmore modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream contains\\nany private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.\\nCan you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a\\npublic mailing list?

It took longer \\nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \\nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \\nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \\nmade. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \\nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \\neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \\nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \\nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \\nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll \\nwrite more about what I learned. \\n\\n  \\n\\nOne benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to \\nhave someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \\nright hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently \\ninfested with cranes.

Glenn \"802.11b Networking News\" Fleishman took great \\nnotes through the talk: \\n\\n    Dan: Tim, you\\'re a \"content or copyright holder\\x85talk about these issues.\" \\n\\n    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. \\n    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is \\n    wrong: most aren\\'t pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over \\n    for years on shelves for three months, doesn\\'t sell, that\\'s it, and the \\n    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. \\n\\n    Oblivion is fate of most books: \"Piracy would be the best thing for those \\n    books.\" People wouldn\\'t pirate them in general, because people generally \\n    like to respect the rights of creators. \"Piracy is a marginal act; it takes \\n    away some of the cream.\" \\n\\n    Publishing won\\'t go away, but it will change the idea of who is a \\n    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a \\n    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often \\n    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and \\n    position in bookstores. \\n\\n    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will \\n    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? \\n\\n    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa.

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \\nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\\n\\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \\nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \\n\\nJay\\'s correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \\npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \\nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\\nbeing developed, and I don\\'t see any problems with synthetics ultimately \\nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \\ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\\n\\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \\ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\\n\\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\\n\\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\\n\\n\\n\\n********************************************************************\\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.\\n\\nBuffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like \\nGTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply \\nwarning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is \\na belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of \\nprimetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should \\nair during that time. I don\\'t believe that it\\'s the networks\\' responsibility to \\nrestrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The \\nshows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and \\nsome aren\\'t. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents \\nand children wish to watch TV together during this hour.\\n\\nIt should be the parent\\'s responsibility to police a child\\'s television \\nviewing. If you don\\'t want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then \\ndon\\'t let them, but don\\'t campaign to have the show removed from the air or \\nshoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because \\nyou don\\'t like its content. If you don\\'t think a show is appropriate, don\\'t let \\nyour kids watch it.\\n\\nThe PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example \\nof one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show \\ninappropriate for kids.

Daev Walsh forwards an article from\\nThe Irish Digest about \\'\\'Billy in the Bowl\\'\\'.  This story is also immortalised\\nin an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy\\nwas a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I\\nnow live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely\\nlegal, way to make money.\\n\\nBlogEnd: \\nLinkText: Billy in the Bowl\\n\\nFrom:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>\\nSubject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\\n\\nA story of my new neighbourhood...\\n\\n\\nThe Irish Digest July 1964\\n\\n\\nThe Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\\n\\nThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.\\nThen, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life \\n\\nDUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the\\narchitectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of\\nbeggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these\\nbeggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one\\nwho campaigned among the working class.  This was \"Billy In The Bowl\"\\n\\nThe strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy\\'s sole means\\nof transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this \"\\nbowl \", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground\\nwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.\\n\\nBilly\\'s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been\\nborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing\\nhim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an\\nunusually handsome face.\\n\\nThis was Billy\\'s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating\\nsympathetic passers-by from their small change.\\n\\nThe cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many\\nlonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century\\nGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would\\ncome along.\\n\\nHe would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his\\nblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a\\nhandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\\n\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\", however, wasn\\'t satisfied with becoming the daily\\nowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were\\nsubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could\\nindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.\\n\\nAs a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.\\nThe first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening\\nas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing\\nthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on\\nDublin\\'s North Quays.\\n\\nWhen Billy heard the woman\\'s footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a\\nditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the\\nbeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.\\n\\nTrembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay\\nconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two\\npowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.\\n\\nIn a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy\\nwas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his \" bowl \", his victirn\\'s\\npurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\\nfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\\nassailant.  And, as \"Billy in the Bowl\" had figured, nobody would suspect a\\ndeformed beggar.\\n\\nAgain and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting\\nthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.\\n\\nOn one occasion \" Billy in \"the Bowl \" tried his tactics on a sturdy\\nservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to\\nstrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder\\nand caused a great stir.\\n\\nHundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this\\nperiod, Dublin\\'s first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first\\ncase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.\\n\\nMonths passed and  \"Billy in the Bowl\" reverted once again to his old\\npasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and\\nrobbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a\\nnightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled\\nalong in his \"bowl\" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that\\nfinished Billy\\'s career of crime.\\n\\nTwo stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment\\nafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to\\nhear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the\\nditch.\\n\\nBilly, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and\\ntried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,\\nhowever) and while resisting tore \\'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her\\nlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.\\n\\nThe screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the\\ndistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member\\nof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\\n\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but\\nthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The\\nGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive\\nDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed\\nand giggled as they wended their way home at night.\\n\\n\\n\\ndaev\\n\\n_______________________________\\nRev.

This is because any granting of \\nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\\nin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and \\ntimes. In the absence of such limitations, the \\noriginal author has the right to change his \\nsoftware back to closed on a whim.\\n\\n\\n{\\n\\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \\nholder automatically retains the right to change \\nthe licence.\\n\\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \\nall *copyright holders*\\n\\nThat\\'s not my understanding. French law allows a \\nGPL type licence *_on condition_* that the \\nspecific conditions of the granting of such\\nrights are clear - if they are not, there is\\nnothing to stop the original author taking\\nback \"his work\". The lawyers see this\\n(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n4) Hidden defects.\\n\\nRoughly, this clause means that the author(s) \\nis/are liable for any defects if the consumer \\nis not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up \\nand data is lost, then the authors are liable.\\n\\n\\n{\\n\\nCiaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have \\nsimilar clauses - the point here is that they \\nare *_all_* invalid - just that this one \\naffects the GPL also.\\n\\nNiall O\\'Broinn makes the point that it is not\\na sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement\\nand that\\'s why it doesn\\'t come under this point.\\n\\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\\narticle has been to see software \"sales\" (even\\nif no money changes hands) as governed very\\nmuch by consumer law (in France anyway).\\n\\n\\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\\nare not default. \\n\\nSee the bit about even the granting of \\nrights by an author having to be \\nexplicitly specified - under French law.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \\nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n5) Roughly.\\n\\nThere may be other reasons under French \\nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid.\\n\\n\\n\\n-----  Whole Article. -----------\\n\\n\\nFreedom(a) is worth more than these \\nimperfect licences.\\n\\n\\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL.\\n\\n\\n\\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to \\nthe court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both \\nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \\nexamine the \"free\" licences and in particular the \\nGPL. They have published their study\\nin the review \"Proprietes intellectuelles \\n(Intellectual property)[1]\" and their\\nconclusion is grim.\\n\\n\\nTheir approach is interesting. The problem for \\nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \\nFrench law (for them the question is a moot point)\\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \\nand the content of the text of free licences, and \\nin particular the GPL. The problem is not free \\nprogrammes, but rather the licence contracts of \\nfree programmes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbsence of critical clauses.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe authors tell us that first of all, the \\nreference to \"copyright\" is not legally \\nsufficient in the framework of international \\ncontracts  (which is the case of licence \\ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \\nvia the Internet). The idea of copyright can \\nbasically include differences from one country \\nto another. This is why, under international \\ncontracts, it is necessary to specify to which \\nlaws one is referring (French law, American &c.).\\n\\nThe authors only found three public licences \\nwhich were correctly formulated on this point: \\nQPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\\nLicence).\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecification in the English language.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, the authors remind us that (at least in \\nFrance), no clause in a contract may be contrary \\nto French law [2]. However, it turns out that a \\nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \\nin several respects. Firstly, it is written in \\nEnglish and the FSF doesn\\'t officially approve \\ntranslations. \\n\\nThe \"Toubon law\" obliges this sort \\nof contract to be written in French, including for \\nbusinesses since the notion of \"user\" applies not \\nonly to consumers, but also to businesses, \\nprofessionals &c. \\n\\n\\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, \\nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as \\nfar as business is concerned, the \"Toubon \\nlaw\" is probably doomed to change since \\nit is in contradiction of European directives \\non the subject, but whatever about that, the \\nproblem is still valid for individuals, and \\nwhile waiting for it (French law) to change, \\nFrench companies have to deal with it, since \\nit is the law of the land.\\n\\n\\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \\nchange licence.\\n\\n\\nAnother problem, much more serious, is \\nthat according to French law, the author of \\na free programme can, at any time, invoke \\nthe invalidity of the licence for this \\nsoftware by simply changing the licence.\\n\\n\\nIn effect, the law of intellectual \\nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \\nrights by the author is subordinate to \\nthe condition that each of these granted \\nrights be the object of a distinct clause \\nin the granting act (i.e. the licence) and \\nthat the granting of any such rights be \\ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \\ngrantees, and also with respect to its \\nlocation (i.e. where such rights may be \\nexcersised)  and duration of any such grants. \\n[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of\\nother free licences. Briefly, this means \\nthat in France, or elsewhere if the author \\nis French, that which is under the GPL could \\nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next. \\n \\n\\n\\nThe problem of the guarantee \"hidden defects\".\\n\\n\\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \\nguarantee. The GPL licences and others show \\nthat the software is delivered \"without \\nguarantee\". You are going to immediately\\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \\nsame clause in their licence contracts,\\nand this is correct. However, whatever is \\nwritten in a licence contract, one cannot\\nfree oneself from the \"guarantee from \\nhidden defects\", since it is imposed in the \\nCivil Code. This concept is poorly understood \\nby the layman, it protects the buyer\\n(whoever it may be, individual or business, \\nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \\nconsumer protection law) against hidden \\ndefects, deliberate or made in good faith by \\nthe seller. \\n\\n\\nFor example, if one buys a pair of socks \\nin a sale, and the shop has a notice \\nspecifying that \"Sale items are neither \\nrefunded nor exchanged\", and on arriving \\nhome you notice that one of the socks has \\na hole in it, several scenarios are possible.\\n\\n\\nYou could have checked the socks before \\npurchase: the flaw is deemed \"obvious\" and\\nyou can sing for your money.\\n\\n\\nYou couldn\\'t check the socks (they were \\npackaged for example), and in this case, \\ndespite the notice \"neither refund nor \\nexchange\", you may invoke \"hidden defect\" \\nand have them changed or obtain a refund, \\nit\\'s up to you. \\n\\nPersonally, I have already invoked in shops \\nthe \"hidden defect\" clause and it always \\nworked well (shopkeepers are always very \\ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \\nof the Civil Code). \\n\\n\\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \\nwide, it is necessary that you hadn\\'t \\nthe possibility of discovering the defect \\nbefore buying the product and then \\n(according to the Civil Code) that you \\nwouldn\\'t have bought it at that price if \\nyou had known about the\\ndefect.\\n\\n\\nThe third case which is much rarer , is \\nif you are able to show that the vendor had\\nknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn\\'t \\ninform you. In this case, not only does he \\nhave to reimburse the product, but all \\nexpenses incurred by the sale (metro \\ntickets to go to the shop, the fuse \\nwhich blew when you plugged it in &c.)\\n\\n\\nThis idea of \"hidden defect\" applies to\\n all products, including programmes. This \\nwas made abundantly clear by the \\nauthorities (and the courts) surrounding \\nY2K. \\n\\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \\nfree programmes, since a site which \\noffers a Linux distro for download is \\nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \\nhidden flaws.\\n\\n\\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \\nin the case of a free programme, \\none could speak about a \"hidden\" defect \\nsince the source code was available, \\nhe replied \"Actually, concerning the \\nguarantee, the question of obvious \\ndefect will arise. This analyis will \\nbe different depending on whether the \\nperson who downloads the distribution \\nis an IT professional or not\". \\n\\nOpenSource has this advantage over \\nthe proprietary programme: it protects \\nthe distributor against a guarantee of\\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \\nIT person. But, for distribution to the \\npublic at large, the problem remains \\nthe same.\\n\\n\\n\\nRoughly Speaking.\\n\\n\\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, \\nthis study is far from being exhaustive \\nand many other areas could be explored. \\n\\nDuring this interview, we asked ourselves, \\nfor example, about the fragility of the \\nGPL clause which forbids linking source \\ncode under the GPL with proprietary code. \\n\\nIn effect, the laws of intellectual \\nproperty give the right to the user \\nto modify a programme with the\\nintention of permitting interoperability \\nwith another programme.

At shopping \\nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \\nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \\npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \\npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \\nask for our votes.\\n\\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \\nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\\n\\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \\nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \\naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \\neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\\n\\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \\nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \\nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \\n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\\n\\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \\nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \\nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \\nthrough any of those channels.\\n\\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \\nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \\nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \\nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \\n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\\n\\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \\nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \\nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \\nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \\nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\\n\\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \\nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \\nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \\nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\\n\\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \\nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \\nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \\nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \\nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \\nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \\ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\\n\\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \\nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \\nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \\npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \\naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\\n\\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \\nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \\nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \\ngroups.\\n\\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \\nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \\nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \\nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \\nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \\nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \\nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \\nadvocacy management and communications software company.

Thus, my book\\nPrinciples of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching\\nmethods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.\\nPerhaps you\\nhave also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune\\nbuggy, etc.). \\n\\nThese analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps\\'\\' to enhance our creativity, but\\nthey\\ncannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must\\nbe\\nbased on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. \\n\\nIn this essay I\\'ll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks\\non a\\nbook about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many\\ndifferences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer\\nrather\\ndirectly. \\n\\nAccording to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call\\n``the\\nthree E\\'s\\'\\': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,\\nwhich\\nBillington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S\\'s). We will consider each in\\nturn. \\n\\n\\nEfficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used\\n\\nIn structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety\\nand the\\nissues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language\\ndesign,\\nefficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where\\nefficiency\\nconsiderations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming\\nLanguages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing\\ntime, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was\\nprogrammer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN\\'s\\nimplicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed\\nfor the\\nsake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). \\n\\nEfficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we\\nare\\nnot comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as\\nprogrammer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are\\nreduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now\\nturn. \\n\\n\\nEconomy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost\\n\\nWhereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks\\nto\\nmaximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges\\nare\\nusually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public\\'\\'\\nthat\\nmust be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these\\nprogrammers work. \\n\\nEconomic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,\\nthe shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost\\nof\\ncomputer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the\\nincreasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of\\nprogram\\nmaintenance compared to program development. \\n\\nOther social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major\\nmanufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some\\nway\\nby influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether\\nit\\ncomes to be perceived as a ``real\\'\\' language (used by ``real programmers\\'\\') or as a ``toy\\'\\' language (used by\\nnovices\\nor dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are\\nfrequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming\\nlanguage. \\n\\nOften economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are\\noften\\nunstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from\\ndissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately\\nrepresented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost\\'\\' and ``benefit\\'\\' must be considered\\nin\\nseeking an economical design. \\n\\n\\nElegance Symbolizes Good Design\\n\\n``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?\\'\\' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the\\ncritical\\nrole of elegance in ``hard-nosed\\'\\' engineering. \\n\\nFor the Designer\\n\\nIt is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the\\ndifficulty\\nof analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).\\nStructural\\nengineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don\\'t\\nmake\\nextensive use of computer models and calculation. \\n\\nOne reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which\\nvariables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this\\ndecision is not\\nmade well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this\\nis\\nanother potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical\\nanalysis\\nmay overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of\\nsafety is\\nadditional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). \\n\\nSimilarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a\\nchoice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an\\nover-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. \\n\\nMany people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it\\nvibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.\\nBillington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a\\nconsequence of\\nan increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed\\nthe\\nTacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided\\nby aesthetic principles. \\n\\nAccording to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do\\nnot\\nabandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because\\nsolutions to\\nstructural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible\\nsolutions to a\\nparticular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention\\nto\\ndesigns in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are\\nunbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. \\n\\nThe general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can\\nbe\\nguided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea\\nby\\ninverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds\\n(p.\\n21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.\\'\\' In other words, the choice of\\nform is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and\\neconomical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. \\n\\nThe same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the\\ninteraction\\nof features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our\\naesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having\\nto\\ncheck all the possible interactions. \\n\\nFor the User\\n\\nIn this case, what\\'s good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge\\nthat\\nlooks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which\\nfeatures may ``explode\\'\\' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed\\nbridge\\ngives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should\\nreinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the\\nconsequences\\nof our actions. \\n\\nWe accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to\\nsustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won\\'t much matter that it was beautiful on the\\noutside.\\nSo also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation\\nof a\\ndeep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their\\n(unwarranted)\\nconfidence. \\n\\nIn summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a\\nconsequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or\\nprogramming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited\\nvalue unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the\\npreceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: \\n                                The Elegance Principle\\n\\n              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Programming Language as Work Environment\\n\\nThere are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming\\nlanguage is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable\\nand\\nsafe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that\\ntake\\nplace within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? \\n\\nA programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer\\'s\\nfatigue\\nand frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,\\nencouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines\\'\\' and work as a\\nnatural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine\\'\\' by encouraging\\nthe programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming\\nlanguage should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. \\n\\nThrough its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of\\nits features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may\\nrepresent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming\\nlanguage can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by\\nneglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.\\nOut of\\nsight, out of mind. \\n\\n\\nAcquiring a Sense of Elegance\\n\\nAesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined\\nsense\\nof elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive\\nexperience\\nin design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.\\nBecause of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each\\ncompetition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public\\nalso\\ncritiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along\\nwith that of the designers. \\n\\nSo also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -\\nand criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people\\'s designs\\nand try\\nto improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing\\'\\'\\ncomes\\nalong. \\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n   1.Billington, David P., The Tower and the Bridge: The New Art of Structural Engineering, Princeton:\\n     Princeton University Press, 1983.

Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British\\n countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,\\n vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,\\n including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair\\n samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its\\n undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. \\n \\n Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,\\n founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has\\n received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. \\n \\n \\x93During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat\\n activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from\\n the public has been fantastic,\\x94 Mr Bamping said. \\x93Big cats in Britain are\\n real. They are out there, they are breeding; there\\x92s more of them.\\x94 \\n \\n Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark\\n Fraser, who heads the society\\x92s Scottish arm, said: \\x93Lynx are now present in\\n the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I don\\x92t\\n want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several\\n hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.\\x94 \\n \\n Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which\\n includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as\\n well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in\\n Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand\\n was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black\\n hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. \\n \\n The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of\\n trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the\\n beasts, which it will then present to the Government. \\n \\n It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.\\n Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. \\n \\n Next in August: record abductions by aliens.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

It took two hours to find her.\\n\\n\"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all\\nmy clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,\" he said. \"I\\nknew then there was something special.\"\\n\\nMoylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet\\n-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,\\nwho is expecting their first child.\\n\\nCritics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women\\nin developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that\\noften turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand\\nin search of a wife.\\n\\n\"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I\\'d met Wan,\" he said. \"I knew I\\nfound her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.\"\\n\\nMoylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in\\ntouch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and\\nthe couple married.\\n\\nMR. MARRIAGE\\n\\nLawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency\\nMoylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself \"Mr. Marriage,\"\\nstarted the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction\\nagency.\\n\\nSince then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.\\n\\n\"In the last five years we\\'ve done about 400,\" he said. \"To the best of my\\nknowledge, they have all been successful.\"\\n\\nMale clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that\\nrequire them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.\\nClients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women\\nlooking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.\\n\\nClients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch\\'s\\noffice -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and\\nlanguage problems.\\n\\n\"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,\"\\nLynch said. \"But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.\"\\n\\nAfter the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know\\neach other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every\\nclient has found a potential wife.\\n\\n\"At the end of a fortnight it\\'s very, very rare for a guy to go back and\\nthink he hasn\\'t made his mind up,\" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,\\nusually within the next year.\\n\\nRoongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a\\nBangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less\\nthan 10 percent have broken up.\\n\\nRoongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just\\narrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.\\n\\n\"Sometimes they are very nervous,\" she said. \"And sometimes they are very\\nimpatient and say \\'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.\\' I say: \\'Calm\\ndown, OK, we\\'ll talk.\"\\'\\n\\nBut if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife\\nand get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives\\nfor include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic\\nstress disorder.\\n\\nWHY?\\n\\nSimilar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics\\nsay they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to\\nform relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of\\nimpoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.\\n\\nBut Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is\\nno reason to object. \"If you talk about people who are needy, I think\\neverybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I\\nneed Wan,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there\\'s no\\nsecret there. They are looking for a better life. I don\\'t have a problem\\nwith that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to\\ntheir future husband.\"\\n\\nLynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they\\nchoose to use his agency.\\n\\nHis brochure promises an alternative to the \"kind of de-feminized,\\nover-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British\\nsingles scene,\" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are\\nnot \"God\\'s gift to women.\"\\n\\nRoongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their\\nown countries -- and found Thai women attractive.\\n\\n\"They don\\'t know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques\\nor restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?\\nImpossible,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are\\ngood at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from\\nladies from other countries.\"\\n\\nAlthough many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,\\nthe agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also\\nnot a major obstacle.\\n\\n\"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having\\na husband who is significantly older,\" Lynch said. \"When I met my wife she\\ncouldn\\'t speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic\\ndictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up\\nvery quickly.\"\\n\\nMany agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move\\nto the West.\\n\\n\"We have kitchens, we have study classes,\" Roongthip said. \"We teach them\\nhow to eat, and when to make tea.\"\\n\\nPITFALLS\\n\\nBut not all dreams come true. \"Bee\" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to\\nSwitzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is\\nback in Bangkok, sad and angry.\\n\\n\"He had no friends, and I was so lonely,\" she said. \"I tried to make him\\nhappy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never\\nspoke to me.\"\\n\\nBee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. \"I thought I would be happy\\nthere,\" she said. \"But it was the worst time of my life.\"\\n\\nLynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure\\nunsuitable candidates are weeded out.\\n\\n\"We are ethical and professional,\" he said. \"We will not take on all\\ncomers.\"\\n\\nMoylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the\\narrangement can work. Wan\\'s sister has just signed up with Lynch\\'s company,\\nlooking for a foreign husband.\\n\\n\"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I\\'m sure there are,\"\\nMoylan said. \"But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the\\nway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\\nsea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,\\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\\nfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\\nmaybe me and you, too.\\nBut B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza\\'s budget since the\\nBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded\\nhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic\\nproto-warriors in the background.\\nYou must know Hamza; he\\'s the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily\\nMail\\'s cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye\\ncovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don\\'t\\nmock the disabled any more these days, unless it\\'s someone like Hamza whom\\nwe don\\'t like; then, if you\\'ll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come\\noff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the\\nBritish right) as \"Captain Hook\", in articles which usually call for his\\narrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and\\nthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if\\nwe can\\'t lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him\\nto shut up.\\nBecause we don\\'t like Hamza very much. We weren\\'t that fond of him before\\nSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all\\nthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political\\npersecution.\\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they\\'ve\\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\\nmanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of\\ncontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But\\nperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and\\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror\\'s\\nscoop.\\nHamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier\\nthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\\nallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn\\'t know Charity Commissioners were\\nmeant to do stuff like that.\\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been\\nfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the\\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\\nand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly\\n- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be\\ntrue - Hamza is not \"representative\" of British Muslims, as if British\\nMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\\nturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.\\nThe trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\\nrevealed to be rather more \"representative\" than the list of those\\ngovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -\\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.\\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4\\'s Today programme revealed that an\\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush\\'s crusade.\\nOne in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US\\n(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought\\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.\\nWhich is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the\\ntime, we didn\\'t want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at\\nhome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from\\nthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US\\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action\\nagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.\\nNor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don\\'t\\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday\\'s Guardian,\\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\\nfor the sheikh\\'s message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.\\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\\nbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more\\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His\\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be\\nhappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for\\nexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly\\nrepellent.\\nAnd that\\'s the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\\nto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful\\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\\nruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.\\nMulticulturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that\\nare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.\\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing\\nremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution\\nis simply the pungency of his views.\\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This\\nis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.\\nYou don\\'t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn\\'t exist. And\\nif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of\\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is\\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man\\nup, therefore, won\\'t make a difference.\\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:\\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.\\nBut if you break the bloody glass, you won\\'t hold up the weather.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

What the WSJ said, appended below.\\n\\n\\nThe WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,\\nexpropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at\\nthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\"\\nof the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else\\nto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized\\ncrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world\\'s richest\\nnation.\\n\\nNow, of course, it\\'s about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago\\nhave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally\\nirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in\\ngovernment.\\n\\nAs a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly\\nusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will\\nbe \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and\\nspecial-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the\\ncryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize\\nto such perfection.\\n\\n\\nAll this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded\\nby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not\\nreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch\\'s name.\\n*Commerce*.\\n\\n\\nIf they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites\\nwho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects\\non a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called\\n\"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the\\nhighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,\\nforeign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.\\n\\nIf the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for\\na memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the\\nfamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the\\nproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the\\nevent.\\n\\nAnd, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as\\ntall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square\\nfeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.\\n\\n\\nIn these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic\\ninternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially\\ndecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,\\neconomics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition\\nand statism.\\n\\nIt\\'s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower\\nManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but\\nit\\'s going to happen sooner or later.\\n\\nAnd, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who\\ndied at the World Trade Center.\\n\\nCheers,\\nRAH\\n\\n- -------\\n\\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html\\n\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\n\\nSeptember 11, 2002\\nREVIEW & OUTLOOK\\n\\nA Living Memorial\\n\\nAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the\\nsix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone\\nelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\\ndied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who\\nperished would be a living one.\\n\\nThe site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\\nespecially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\\nheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\\nworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of\\nproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin\\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.\\n\\nBut restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\\nbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\\nTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\\nscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\\nclamoring for a piece of the action. New York\\'s political leadership,\\nand its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\\nto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.\\n\\nThis is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\\nwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor\\nGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November\\nre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the\\nmemorial. The Manhattan Institute\\'s Steve Malanga argues that the\\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\\nfor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\\nto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\\nsuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\\nan outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.\\n\\nA big part of the problem in New York is that the city\\'s\\nanti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They\\nwant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\\n- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have\\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World\\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are\\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\\nanti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One\\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.\\n\\nWe are not experts in designing war memorials, but we\\'re confident\\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world\\'s financial center\\nisn\\'t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great\\ncities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all\\nrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\\nlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port\\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a\\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.\\n\\nIn this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to\\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\\naffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,\\nyou\\'ll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\\nWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World\\nWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it\\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\\naround the walls containing their names.\\n\\nIn New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city\\'s future.\\nRudolph Giuliani, now that he\\'s out office, wants the entire 16 acres\\ndevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures\\non the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would\\nseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\\npress and has since ducked for cover.\\n\\nMaybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe\\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best\\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: PGP 7.5\\n\\niQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273\\nfgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2\\n=09az\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

I\\'m not a C programmer,\\nbut I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are\\ninstructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile\\nprocess, and include all sorts of symbols/functions\\ne.g. \"#include <math.h>\" gives you maths type functions.  Since they\\nstart with \"#\" they are ignored in the final compilation.\\n\\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \\nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\\n    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4\\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to\\npersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this\\nis the right way to proceed.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the steps above regarding \"make dep\" and so forth\\nshould have been performed in the directory where the make process is\\nlooking for modversions.h & Co.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as\\nyou describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you\\nhave done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after\\nthat, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)\\nfiles.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files\\ndon\\'t really belong there).\\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth I think you are very close to a successful\\ncompilation.\\n\\nm\\n\\n> \\n> Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed \"make\", I noticed\\n> that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h\\n> file.

As \\nseveral people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their \\nmost recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used \\nto be the #1 \"mark\"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an \\nattempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and \\nGoogle bombing[3]. \\n\\nSpecifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked \\nsite, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the \\nlinked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for \"go to hell\"\\n[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for \"talentless hack\"[6] \\nno longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were \\npreviously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on \\nwhether Google is actively penalizing such sites. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have \\ncaused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on \\nmedium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far \\nas page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work \\nputting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive \\nwith complaints and speculation: \\n\\n- New update, pagerank death?[8] \\n- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] \\n- Let\\'s find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] \\n\\n(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no \\nlonger indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely \\nfalse. Searching diveintomark.org for \"gimli\"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]\\n, where \"Gimli\" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) \\n\\nRegardless, Google\\'s search results in general appear to be significantly \\ndegraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam \\nsites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so \\ngood at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing \\nfrequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they\\'re \\ntracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It \\ndidn\\'t take long. \\n\\n- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a \\nhotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems \\nunhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and \\nGoogle absolutely knows I\\'m in the US based on my IP address). \\n- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC \\nnewspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet \\nbetting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. \\n- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent \\nsite, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself \\n(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I \\ndidn\\'t care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn\\'t \\nthat helpful. \\n\\nMany people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com\\n[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their \\nresults for \"eminem\"[22] do appear to be much more relevant.

Web forms.  There\\'s\\npromising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the\\nindustry:\\n\\n o You find something that you want to fill out.  It\\'s a partnership form,\\n   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.\\n o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend\\n   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops\\n   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback\\n   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it\\'s really worth your\\n   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. \\n o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.\\n   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world\\n   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you\\n   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the \"more>\" tag on the second\\n   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except\\n   about two dozen third world countries. \\n o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain\\n   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause\\n   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.\\n o When you get something that\\'s not entered right, you will go back and\\n   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will\\n   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to\\n   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations\\n   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.\\n o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  \\n o Sometimes, like today, you won\\'t be able to ever submit anything due\\n   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that\\n   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their\\n   forms submission.\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting\\nyour time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I\\'m sure there\\'s\\nsomeone in that company that would be willing to accept \"US\", \"U.S\", \"USA\"\\n\"United States\", \"U of A\", \"America\", etc. and would know exactly which\\nfreaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them\\nto waste even more time playing Web form geography.  \\n\\nI\\'m starting to see the light of Passport.

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It\\'s very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they\\'re here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\\' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\\nfact.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

It\\'s a pretty basic \\nbrowser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified \\nbrowsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 \\nand his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time \\nslightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla\\'s no tolerance \\npolicy for regressions.\\n\\nWhile this \"line in the sand\" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it \\nmisses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to \\nadd features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see \\nfeatures removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, \\nrelying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the \\nuser interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last \\nfeature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!\\n\\nYou can really only cram so many features into a product before its size \\nrequirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious \\nrule. It\\'s like you start with an empty elevator that says \"Capacity: 10 \\npeople.\" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of \\npeople (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the \\nsecond floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it \\ncontinues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, \\nbut there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of \\nthem squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla \\nsidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes \\nhe\\'d get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn\\'t. \\nSomeone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way \\nto the third floor, so he\\'s useless, and everyone wishes he\\'d get off too. He \\ndoesn\\'t though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until \\neventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.\\n\\nWe need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that \\nnobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the \\nfeatures that didn\\'t work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren\\'t there in \\nMozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want \\nsome of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go \\ndownload them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat \\nwill we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This \\nweek, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda \\nreally entails: \\n\\n    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another \\n    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to \\n    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that \\n    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't \\n    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants \\n    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used \\n    to violate copyrights. \\n\\n    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the \\n    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask \\n    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep \\n    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing \\n    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a \\n    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after \\n    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some \\n    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. \\n    Saying it doesn't make it so.  \\n\\nLink[2] Discuss[3]\\n\\n[1] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/4132447.htm\\n[2] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4175607.htm\\n[3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/WDUVXyKf9qUj\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this \\nproblem. They didn\\'t listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that \\ndescribes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:\\n\\n_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn\\'t let you turn off pop-up windows like \\nMozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._\\n\\nPlenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about \\nthese problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We \\nlost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the \\nNetscape browser are incompetent. They don\\'t understand how to make a good \\nbrowser, or they don\\'t care. Their engineers tell them what they\\'re doing \\nwrong, and they don\\'t listen. \\n\\nMaybe you\\'ll listen to the public.

It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\\nJohn Roberts of the association said: \"It has obviously been very well\\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\\nhorn cut out of carpets.\\n\"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\\nnot get another refit for another year.\\n\"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle \\xad a tractor and trailer or a\\nlorry \\xad because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.\"\\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\\nwhitening.\\nMr Roberts added: \"The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\\n\"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\\ntake it away again because it was a major job.\"\\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\\n\"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\\nhas not been a cut in the turf \\xad which would be much more of a problem. It\\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.\"\\nAn RCA spokesman said: \"Some people in the country are getting very\\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\\ndon\\'t seem to be doing anything good.\"\\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: \"The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.\"\\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The spam \\noften appears to originate there because it\\'s coming from open \\nhttp, or squid proxy servers.  It\\'s hosted there because these \\nspammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.

Oh, look, it\\'s still there, including the nude \\nphotos:\\n\\nhttp://belps.freewebsites.com/\\n\\nI recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in \\nconfirming the validity of the information found online.  There \\nwere some \"interesting\" conversations. This summer, the SEC \\nreleased the following:\\n\\nhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm\\n\\nYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty \\nfor operating a pump-and-dump scam isn\\'t small.

In recent years,\\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\\nto the common cold, studies show. \\n\\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \\n\\n\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\\nConnection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\\nis bad for my health and I\\'m disbanding it.\" \\n\\nAnother book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\\n\"There\\'s this myth that friendships should last a\\nlifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it\\'s better that\\nthey end.\" \\n\\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\\nas more important. \\n\\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\\nbad. \\n\\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\\nLerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\\nbest friend hits me.\" \\n\\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \\n\\n\"Now that a marital relationship can\\'t be counted on for\\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\\na way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\\nFehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \\n\\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\\nfocused on its health benefits. \"Now we\\'re starting to look\\nat it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\\na professor of psychology at Florida International\\nUniversity in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\\nnegative characteristics.\" \\n\\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \\n\\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\\npursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\\nEnron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\\nantisocial behavior.\" \\n\\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\\nsplit up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\\n\\n\\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It\\'s\\nmore than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\\ntreatment is actually malicious.\" \\n\\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend\\'s\\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\\nLerner\\'s patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\\nthere and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\\nthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\\nresponded to Dr. Yager\\'s most recent survey on friendship\\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\\n\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\\nbut it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\\nconstantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They\\'ll\\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\\nshe finds out.\" \\n\\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\\nwho meddles too much in a friend\\'s life, the competitor and\\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \\n\\nMost common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\\nfrom the person who says let\\'s have a cup of coffee but\\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\\nisn\\'t,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\\nto dislike the other one. \\n\\n\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\\ndiscover there\\'s something important they don\\'t like about\\nthe other person,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\\n\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\\nperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\\nother\\'s dislike criteria.\" \\n\\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\\n\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \\n\\n\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\\nsomething go,\" she added. \"It\\'s also an act of maturity\\nsometimes to accept another person\\'s limitations.\" \\n\\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\\nfrom each one. \\n\\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\\nget together, ever. \\n\\n\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\\nbut only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\n\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\\nthem in order while you\\'re healthy and your life and work\\nare going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\\nlife-preserving good friendship is.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n\\n\\n',\n",

And the bandwidth shadows in most cities\\nare surprisingly large and common.  They aren\\'t selling the software, which\\nis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next\\ngeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large\\nscale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless\\nconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and\\nothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit\\nconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize\\nthe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless\\nis tied into fiber at multiple points.\\n\\nThe canopies we are talking about aren\\'t short-range wifi technologies, but\\na mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth\\nmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to\\nwell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and\\nbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an\\norder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and\\nproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the\\ncost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers\\ncan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low\\nbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of\\nlarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective\\nbandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company\\'s\\nlong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to\\nkeep things sane.\\n\\nOr at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,\\nespecially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the\\nsystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more\\nefficient).\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It is the\\nstandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\\nworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\\nimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\\nfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\\nof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\\nrecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. \\n\\nHow can I read a MIME message?\\n\\nSince MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\\nwhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\\nnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\\nMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\\nUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\\nftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)\\n\\nIn addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\\ncapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\\nnot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\\nstill hope! \\n\\nThere are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\\nmessage.  One of the more versatile is called \"munpack\".  It was developed\\nat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\\nhost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\\navailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\\nolder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\\ndecode messages in split-uuencoded format. \\n\\nDoes MIME replace UUENCODE?\\n\\nYes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\\nthat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\\nlimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\\nencoding called \"Base64\" which has been carefully designed to survive the\\nmessage transformations made by certain email gateways. \\n\\nHow can I learn more about MIME?\\n\\nThe MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via\\nanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: \\n                                                       \\n     o  US East Coast                            \\n        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        \\n                                                        \\n     o  US West Coast                            \\n        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      \\n                                                        \\n     o  Pacific Rim                              \\n        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)  \\n                                                        \\n     o  Europe                                   \\n        Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) \\n\\nLook for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt\\n\\nAnother source of information is the Internet news group \"comp.mail.mime\",\\nwhich includes a periodic posting of a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" list.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n',\n",

Jason \\nLevine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who \\nimplemented it, and she claims it wasn\\'t a protest as such, more of an inside \\njoke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in \\ngeneral) is to make everyone\\'s words look the same. Counterpoint: the default \\nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody\\'s \\nforcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to \\ninsert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. \\n\\n_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format \\nformerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. \\n\\n_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war \\nbetween RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. \\nSo today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn\\'t XML. It \\nisn\\'t RDF. It\\'s just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type \\ndoesn\\'t support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an \\nimpediment to mainstream acceptance. \\n\\n_Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I\\'m not buying into RSS \\n0.9x.

However, the additional \\ninformation won\\'t be required.\\n\\nThe opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as \\ncampaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the \\nsame time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous \\npolitical spam.\\n\\nTarget Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had \\nasked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring \\nfinancial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would \\nuse up too much of the 160 character-maximum.\\n\\nPolitical messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from \\nthe financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless\\' petition was \\nsupported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular \\nTelecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade \\ngroups.\\n\\nFEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the \\ncommission\\'s policy not to meddle with new technology that has the \\npotential to reach more voters.\\n\\n\"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before \\neveryone understands how the technology is going to work,\" he said.\\n\\nOpponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or \\nallow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political \\nmessages while remaining anonymous.\\n\\nBiersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.\\n\\nTarget Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as \\n\"good for America.\"\\n\\n\"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running \\nfor office,\" he said. \"We have free speech on our side.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------080808010909060409040405--\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n',\n",

He offended conservatives and the\\n# politically correct left with his 1998 novel \"Les Particules\\n# Elementaires\" (\"Atomised\" in English).\\n#\\n# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted\\n# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme\\n# admit he felt \"a quiver of glee\" every time a \"Palestinian\\n# terrorist\" was killed.\\n#\\n# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National\\n# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in\\n# bringing Houellebecq to trial.\\n#\\n# France\\'s Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying\\n# Houellebecq\\'s comments amounted to \"Islamophobia\" and deserved to be\\n# sanctioned as part of the league\\'s struggle against discrimination\\n# and racism.\\n#\\n# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France\\'s leading\\n# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former\\n# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for\\n# sending Jews to death camps.\\n#\\n# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?\\n#\\n# Houellebecq\\'s lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case\\n# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact\\n# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says\\n# Houellebecq\\'s opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.\\n#\\n# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour\\n# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the\\n# article before it appeared.\\n#\\n# Houellebecq\\'s publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the\\n# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France\\'s\\n# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.\\n#\\n# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached\\n# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to\\n# love.\\n#\\n# Translated into 25 languages, \"Atomised\" incensed France\\'s 1968\\n# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won\\n# him France\\'s November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the\\n# world\\'s biggest fiction prizes.\\n#\\n# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.\\n\\n- Gordon\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\\'s team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \\n2001, DataPower\\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99), the \\nindustry\\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n\\nToday, XG3\\x99 technology powers the industry\\'s first wire-speed XML \\nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\nServices.

Investors for \\nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \\nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \\nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower\\x92s Board of \\nDirectors.\\n\\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and \\nsales of the company\\x92s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. \\nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world\\x92s first intelligent XML \\nnetworking\\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions \\nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \\nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower\\x92s solutions are based on \\nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99) technology.\\n\\n\"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \\nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \\nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \\nDataPower\\x92s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \\nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \\napplications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \\nTechnology.\\n\\n\"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that\\x92s critical to Web \\nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance.\" A single \\nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \\nservers\\x97breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \\nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \\naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \\nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \\ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \\nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\\n\\n\"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \\nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower\\x92s patent-pending technology addresses \\na very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael \\nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with \\nDataPower\\x92s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \\nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \\nperformance and security pitfalls.\"\\n\\n\"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly \\ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \\nsecurity,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \"DataPower is on \\ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \\nGeneration Three (XG3)\\xa0technology was quite simply the single most \\ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date.\"\\n\\n\"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \\nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \\ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \\nservices,\" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. \"DataPower\\x92s \\nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely \\non XML for mission critical applications.\"\\n\\nAbout Venrock Associates\\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \\nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \\nthat now spans over seven decades.

The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or \\nnationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.\\n\\n\\nIn 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the \\nRev.

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.\\n(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)\\n\\nMost production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few\\nreal world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were\\ntalking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the \"capactior is the\\nwrong choice\" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,\\nit\\'s got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady\\ndischarge curve.\\n\\nBut it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not\\nthe 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those\\nyou dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole\\natoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with\\na fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,\\nand batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.\\n\\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\\n  beberg@mithral.com\\n\\n--- end forwarded text\\n\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported\\n   to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don\\'t think the\\n   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,\\n   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.\\n\\n2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects\\n   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA\\n   tuning and development.\\n\\n3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off\\n   filters.  And, of course, there\\'s always progression in technology\\n   (by both spammers and non-spammers).\\n\\nThe second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa\\nsignature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used\\nby SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or\\nSHA-1 of each file).\\n\\nThe third problem doesn\\'t really worry me.\\n\\nThese problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique\\nto spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related\\ncorpuses have their own set of problems, of course.\\n\\nIn other words, I don\\'t think there\\'s any replacement for having\\nmultiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute\\ntesting and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution\\n(and I\\'m glad we\\'re working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If\\nyou\\'re going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus\\nof 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that\\nmuch work.  If you don\\'t get enough spam, creating multi-technique\\nspamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And who\\ndoesn\\'t get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)\\n\\nDan\\n\\n\\n',\n",

But the energy\\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\\n\\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\\nand fiscal mess we\\'ll be cleaning up for decades, we\\'re learning what\\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\\n\\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday\\'s finding by a federal\\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\\nCalifornia\\'s Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\\nalso driving up prices.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider\\'s boast in a\\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\\ncongestion.\\'\\'\\n\\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\\nseen. Unfortunately, California\\'s response -- confusion, lawsuits and\\npolicy tweaks -- hasn\\'t been sufficient.\\n\\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers\\'\\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it\\'s foolish to think\\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\\n\\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That\\'s a\\nreasonable approach, but don\\'t expect miracles.\\n\\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,\\'\\'\\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\\ntempting but a bad idea. When there\\'s genuine competition, as we could\\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\\ninject real competition into the market.\\n\\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\\nis essential.\\n\\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\\nboth.\\n\\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California\\'s utilities\\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\\n\\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\\nideas isn\\'t enough.\\n\\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\\n\\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn\\'t\\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\\nreact to last year\\'s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it\\'s\\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\\naltogether.\\n\\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration\\'s energy policies, so\\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\\n\\nIt\\'s pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world\\'s major economies in its\\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\\nyear.\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR. A.

Lupa\\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\\n \\n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\\n \\n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada\\'s colours was torn from his back,\\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\\n \\n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\\n from video footage.\\n \\n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\\n that such episodes belong to the race\\'s ancient traditions.\\n \\n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\\n the cobbles of Siena\\'s main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\\n \\n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals\\' horses, and more, so long as they do not\\n grab their reins.\\n \\n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods\\'\\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\\n Siena\\'s fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\\n \\n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

sets of rules that analyze the use\\nof IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the\\nimages in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the\\ntotal number of images in

And my\\nparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than\\nI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I\\ndo get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand\\nfrom my father.\\n\\nThe income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because\\nit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it\\nis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a\\nconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not\\nsomething that was impressed upon them.\\n\\nThe primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity\\nthat exists separately from the individuals, typically an \"Indian\\nCorporation\" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a\\nsingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from\\ntribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the\\ntribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per\\nperson, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of\\nplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov\\'t and various\\nbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.\\n\\nYou have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes\\nare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their\\nshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very\\nhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy\\ntake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the\\ncorporation often constitutes their sole \"income\" for government accounting\\npurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one\\nworks, they\\'ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those\\ndividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because\\nthey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is\\nthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,\\nmany of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white\\nfolk, not Indians.\\n\\nSecond, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also\\nreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation\\nto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By\\nbenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other\\nordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.\\n\\nIt should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are\\nineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are\\nvery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good\\ncredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the\\nHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has\\nbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have\\ngross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the\\ndividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular\\ncase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before\\ndrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to\\nintelligent investment and use.  They don\\'t eat their seed corn, and have\\nactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,\\nthere is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50\\nmillion annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal\\ngovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This\\nparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures\\nper person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many\\nborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,\\nthe people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand\\ndollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather\\nthan their own pockets.\\n\\nSomewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable\\nassets to these tribes when they\\'ve burned through the ones previously given\\nwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign\\ncompanies.  And the cycle continues.\\n\\nSo what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a\\nnutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.\\n\\nFew women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and\\ngross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during\\npregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very\\nsubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of\\nthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the\\nearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one\\nreservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of\\nthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is\\narbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police\\netc).\\n\\nIn short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a\\nshambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I\\nhave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren\\'t\\nthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I\\ncould tell you that I\\'ve seen that you probably would not believe unless\\nyou\\'d seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but\\nit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good\\nguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,\\nif any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as\\na minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are\\nopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It\\nwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)\\n\\nThere are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous\\nIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and\\nintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is\\nwhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if\\nthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal\\nleaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological\\ncases mentioned above.\\n\\nThe Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent\\nby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high\\nwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is\\njust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to\\nordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The\\npoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my\\noriginal point.\\n\\n\\nOn a tangent:\\n\\nOne thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal\\ncorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate\\nsocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this\\nstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has\\ninterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well\\nover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.\\n\\nIt seems that in a future where \"familial\" ties will be increasingly\\nvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western\\nsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with\\nthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting\\nindividuals.\\n\\nDamn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com \\n\\n\\n\\nOn 9/22/02 3:53 PM, \"John Hall\" <johnhall@evergo.net> wrote:\\n> \\n> As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans\\n> who speak english at home and those who do not.

But rather than\\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\\na \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\\nuser has typed.\\n\\nThis way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\\nallowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can\\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.\\n\\nBut, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\\nIf you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that\\nis typed).   I suspect that\\'s perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a\\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it,\\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.\\n\\nAnd then I wondered about folders with names containing \\'+\\' - the special\\nuse of + as the toggle character means there\\'s no way to type those from\\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\\nrestrictions - there\\'s no way to type a folder name that has a name\\nbeginning with \\'+\\' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\\ntoggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name\\nbeing typed is empty.   I\\'m less happy about that part, but I think I\\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +\\'s in them to\\nexist and be typed.\\n\\nThen, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, \\'s\\' is\\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you\\'ve just typed 123, and\\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\\nshow that message, you can\\'t type \\'s\\', you have to type \\\\r instead.\\nSo I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes\\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is \\'s\\', if you change that to something\\nelse, it will remain \\'s\\' in here.   I don\\'t know enough tk/tcl to have it\\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\\nto bind the same one here.   \\\\r continues to work of course.\\n\\nAnd now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\\nreverted to its usual bindings.\\n\\nIn any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\\n\"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don\\'t think we really\\nneed to fix Brent\\'s way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\\nfor completeness (I haven\\'t run an exmh with the following patch, but not\\nthe previous one, so I don\\'t know for sure that all will be OK then).\\n\\nkre\\n\\n--- select.tcl.WAS\\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\\n+++ select.tcl\\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\\n     bind $w <Any-Key>\\t{SelectTypein %W %A}\\n     bind $w <Key-plus>\\t{SelectToggle %W }\\n+    bind $w <Key-minus>\\t{SelectPrev %W }\\n     bind $w <space>\\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w <Tab>\\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w <Return>\\t{SelectReturn %W}\\n+    bind $w <Key-s>\\t{SelectReturn %W %A}\\n     bind $w <BackSpace>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w <Control-h>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w <Delete>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\\n     append select(sel) $a\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\\n-\\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\\n     }\\n }\\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w +\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\\n \\tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"\\n     } else {\\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\\n     }\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n }\\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\\n+    global select\\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tSelectTypein $w \"-\"\\n+    } else {\\n+\\tcatch {\\n+\\t    incr select(sel) -1\\n+\\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\t}\\n+        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n+    }\\n+}\\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\\n \\tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     }\\n }\\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$a != {}} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w $a\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tif [info exists select(match)] {\\n \\t    set select(sel) $select(match)\\n \\t    unset select(match)\\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\\n \\tunset select(folder)\\n     }\\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\\n+    Exmh_Status \"\"\\n     Exmh_Focus\\n }\\n proc SelectClear { w } {\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-workers mailing list\\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\\n\\n',\n",

From past results,\\nwhat\\'s needed are one or more of the below:\\n        A.

But that\\'s wrong too!  It looks I haven\\'t grokked this part of\\n> your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the\\n> classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,\\n> and no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for\\n> clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren\\'t\\n> exactly 0.5?\\n\\nThere\\'s a brief discussion of this before the definition of\\nMAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are\\nsaved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.\\nThen the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of\\nclues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)\\nis then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of\\nthem.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final\\nprobability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list\\nof clues (else you\\'d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;\\nand massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual\\nreview is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer\\nMAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that\\'s\\nwhy you didn\\'t see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.\\n\\nBefore adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and\\n0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to\\nappear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.\\n\\n>> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!\\n\\n> This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few\\n> similar ones.\\n\\nI just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores\\npunctuation, and strips a trailing \\'s\\' from words, and saves both word\\nbigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a\\nlist of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.\\n\\n> I wonder if there\\'s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and\\nthe\\n> HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in the sidebar, but the\\nbody\\n> text was a serious discussion of \"OO and soft coding\" with lots of highly\\n> technical words as clues (including Zope and ZEO).\\n\\nNo matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.\\nDitto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique \"words\" that get\\n0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of\\nconditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the\\nprobability that \"<body>\" appears in a message is highly correlated with the\\nprob of \"<br>\" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes\\ngrossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you\\nget in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.\\n\\nRead the \"What about HTML?\" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,\\nI\\'ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at\\npython.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to\\njustify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven\\'t done anything\\ngeared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email\\nthat happens to go through python.org.\\n\\nI\\'d prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it\\nstill had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test\\nresults with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the \"What about\\nHTML?\" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,\\n\\n# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here\\n# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.\\n\\nand we\\'ve since done several things that gave significant f-n rate\\nreductions.  I should test that again now.\\n\\n> Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?\\n\\nAlmost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both\\nheaders and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base\\ntokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.\\n\\n> Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make\\n> progress there?\\n\\nI would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman\\nheader decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging\\nthe data is a Mortal Sin and I haven\\'t changed a byte so far), and my spam\\ntoo polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In\\nparticular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they\\'re\\ngoing to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don\\'t even catch\\n\"undisclosed recipients\" in the To header now!).\\n\\n> ...\\n> No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:\\n>\\n>   multipart/mixed\\n>       text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))\\n>       text/html         (long HTML copied from website)\\n\\nAh!

Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying \\ntraffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it \\nreaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central \\nantennas, and improving wireless coverage.\\n\\nAs the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and \\nother devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless \\nnetworking may be inevitable.\\n\\nMesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless \\nnetworks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users \\nconnection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a \\ndial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection \\nspeeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The \\ntechnologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed \\nwireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range \\nprotocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even \\nfaster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.\\n\\nThe range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of \\nmuch use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the \\nproblem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. \\nEven though the range of any individual device is relatively small, \\nbecause (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, \\nconnections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless \\nconnection.\\n\\nBecause mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed \\nto create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building \\ncellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all \\nthat is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around \\n£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the \\nproper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by \\nsoftware.\\n\\nIt also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. \\nUnlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on \\nis unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too \\npleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds \\nacquiring 3G licences.\\n\\nAll that\\'s needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect \\nto the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets \\nbetter, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone \\nnetworks.\\n\\nBut things get very interesting when you realise that when you have \\nhigh-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone\\'s laptops, PDAs, \\nand mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing \\nmusic, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When \\nUltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.\\n\\nAt 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the \\nperson sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. \\nSooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of \\ntheir favourite songs, movies, and video games.\\n\\nBut the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. \\nMeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. \\nInstead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities \\nthat want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works \\nemployees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the \\ncheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for \\nenterprise networks.\\n\\nThe first place average users may use the technology is when it is \\nincorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at \\nhigh speeds, which both companies see happening soon.\\n\\nWhen will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in \\nyour pocket? It\\'s too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service \\nwas initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually \\nsomeone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Rohit]\\n\\nIn your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (\"The\\nSearch Goes On\", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most\\nsubversive aspect of Google\\'s service is not its card catalog, which\\nmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By\\nmaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,\\nif you can get to Google\\'s cache, you can read anything you\\'d like.\\n\\nThe techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce\\nthese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from\\nGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all\\nWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\\nencryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to\\nSSL makes it effectively impossible for a \\'man-in-the-middle\\' to meddle;\\ncensorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in\\nChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of\\nIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in\\nthe article.\\n\\nOf course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic\\ncosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free\\nflow of information, why shouldn\\'t the Broadcasting Board of Governors\\nsponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest\\nof the Web?\\n\\nTo date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector\\nprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just\\nimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure\\naccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom\\nof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most\\nof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.\\n\\nOn second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*\\nthe use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...\\n\\nBest,\\n   Rohit Khare\\n\\n===========================================================\\n\\nThe search goes on\\nChina backtracks on banning Google\\x97up to a point\\n\\nSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING\\n From The Economist print edition\\n\\nIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,\\nis gougou, meaning \\x93doggy\\x94. For the country\\'s fast-growing population of\\nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving\\nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked\\naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China\\x97apparently\\nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to\\nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been\\nrestored.\\n\\nAn unusual climbdown by China\\'s zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More\\nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to\\nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.\\nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by\\nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for\\nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\\n\\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users\\nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.\\nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet\\nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site\\nto far less powerful search engines in China.\\n\\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,\\nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to\\ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking\\nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be\\nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key\\nwords that might indicate undesirable content.

At shopping \\nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \\nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \\npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \\npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \\nask for our votes.\\n\\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \\nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\\n\\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \\nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \\naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \\neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\\n\\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \\nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \\nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \\n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\\n\\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \\nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \\nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \\nthrough any of those channels.\\n\\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \\nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \\nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \\nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \\n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\\n\\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \\nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \\nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \\nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \\nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\\n\\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \\nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \\nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \\nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\\n\\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \\nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \\nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \\nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \\nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \\nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \\ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\\n\\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \\nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \\nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \\npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \\naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\\n\\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \\nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \\nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \\ngroups.\\n\\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \\nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \\nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \\nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \\nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \\nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \\nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \\nadvocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, \\nthe former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is \\nfounder and president of a political e-marketing firm.

It is based on the SysV unix family, so it\\'s quite similar to\\nother unixen like HPUX and SCO.\\n\\n Sun\\'s hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One\\nof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your\\nhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,\\nthey have to fix it. They can\\'t fob you off with \\'that\\'s a software\\nproblem, talk to the software vendor.\\' etc.\\n\\n If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There\\nis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,\\nthough some companies like RedHat don\\'t maintain a sparc port anymore.\\n\\n You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,\\nwho do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,\\nthat has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a\\ncheaper company like Dell, and it\\'ll most likely work, most of the time.\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users\\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n',\n",

Bronson -\\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\\n muscle power. \\n \\n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\\n virtually no cost. \\n \\n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\\n exercise industry. \\n \\n \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"It\\x92s a joke and a big con and they call\\n me a criminal!\" You can\\x92t help feeling he has a point. \\n \\n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty\\x92s pleasure. \\n \\n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison\\x92s famous special unit, which aimed to\\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\\n murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\\n award-winning film. \\n \\n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\\n a frank account of Glasgow\\x92s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\\n critical praise. \\n \\n And Lord Archer doesn\\x92t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt\\n scribbling away as we speak. \\n \\n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson\\x92s publisher, has published many books\\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\\n pragmatic and profound. \\n \\n He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \\n \\n \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" \\n \\n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\\n \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\\n the very essence of who they are. \\n \\n \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\\n good?\" \\n \\n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\\n two days during a jail siege. \\n \\n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" \\n \\n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson\\x92s face sitting on every\\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \\n \\n \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it\\x92s just a load of\\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\\n described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\\n it\\x92s our choice, I\\x92m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\\n your face with shit you become shit, that\\x92s logical to me.\" \\n \\n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\\n we all needed. \\n \\n \\n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\\n be available in bookstores from October at £7.99\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

It doesn\\'t look too hard.\\n\\nNot to beat a dead horse, but that\\'s exactly what my spamcan package\\ndid.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I\\nknew about Tim & co\\'s work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from\\n<http://woozle.org/~neale/src/spamcan/spamcan.html>, but I\\'m not going\\nto work on it anymore.\\n\\nI\\'m currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest\\'s\\nbooty-kicking tokenizer).  I\\'ll probably have something soon, like maybe\\nhalf an hour, and no, it\\'s not too hard.  The hard part is storing the\\ndata somewhere.  I don\\'t want to use ZODB, as I\\'d like something a\\nperson can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is\\nlooking like my best option.\\n\\nI already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy\\'s SpamOracle, which\\ndoes the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new\\nheader, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.\\n\\nHere\\'s how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:\\n\\n  train-eggs\\n  train-spam\\n  trained-eggs\\n  trained-spam\\n\\nYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the \"train-\" boxes as you get it.\\nHow frequently you do this would be up to you, but you\\'d get better\\nresults if you did it more often, and you\\'d be wise to always copy over\\nanything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy\\nswoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of\\nthings you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she\\'s\\ndone, she moves your mail into the \"trained-\" folders.\\n\\nThis would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read\\ntheir mail right off the server.  I\\'ve spoken with some fellows at work\\nabout Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports\\nappropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.\\n\\nAdvanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail\\nclient to bind the key \"S\" to \"move to train-spam\" and \"H\" to \"move to\\ntrain-eggs\".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it\\'d\\nstart showing up in mail clients.  That\\'s the \"delete as spam\" button\\nPaul Graham was talking about.\\n\\n* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word \"ham\" as the\\n  opposite of \"spam\", and they\\'ve been amazingly cool about the use of\\n  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling\\n  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as\\n  \"eggs\".\\n\\nNeale\\n',\n",

The incident illustrates\\n how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an\\n election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to\\n those of the Führer. \\n \\n \\x93Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the\\n present Chancellor,\\x94 said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union\\n headquarters in Ingolstadt. \\x93Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the\\n flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,\\x94 said the letter,\\n signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. \\n \\n The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. \\x93Many thanks for your nice\\n thoughts,\\x94 replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for\\n membership. \\n \\n The letter used chunks of Hitler\\x92s book, which is still banned in Germany.\\n History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.\\n \\n \\n \\x93The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of\\n existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,\\x94\\n the letter-writer said. \\x93So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March\\n sun.\\x94 Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler\\n was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. \\n \\n Similar letters, also using the Nazi leader\\x92s words, were sent to the other\\n political parties and drew sympathetic responses. \\x93I read your letter with\\n great interest and pleasure,\\x94 the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in\\n Cologne, said. \\n \\n \\x93Great that you want to join us!\\x94 enthused the Green Party headquarters. The\\n Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball\\n at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the\\n star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by\\n Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. \\n \\n \\x93I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing\\n extremism,\\x94 said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist\\n Rainer Popp. \\x93I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. \\n \\n \\x93For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special\\n Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called \\x97 with packets of\\n election material from zealous political headquarters,\\x94 Herr Popp said. \\n \\n \\x93I was stunned that political parties could react in this way \\x97 I reckon I\\n would have had the same response if I had signed the letter \\x91Adolf Hitler\\x92.\\x94\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The api that I\\'m using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), \\nand the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. \\n\\nI can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not \\nthe most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the \\ndatabase, but the database is accessible from the web application. \\nAssuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the \\ndatabase password, I can use a different database with different \\nuser... Argh... to complex and doesn\\'t really solve the problem.\\n\\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\\n\\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \\nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \\nAfter all, I\\'m a real beginner in secure programming, and I\\'m here to \\nlearn methods and technics.\\n\\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \\nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \\ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \\n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \\nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \\nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\\n\\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \\nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \\nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \\nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \\ndb connection/password to the main web application.\\n\\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \\nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \\naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \\nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \\napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \\nbackground).\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nThank you,\\nMario Torre\\n-- \\nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\\nSee http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html \\n\\n',\n",

SmartCards are \\ndesigned to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the \\n$1-20 range (depending on the application).\\n\\nAs whether or not they are \"trusted hardware\", the question again revolves \\naround attacker and timeframe.

Just for the record - \\nthe average salary for\\na university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ \\n21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder\\nhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call \\ncenters that\\nhave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some \\nentry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an\\nhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in \\n1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference\\nis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other \\nwords, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, \\n union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument \\nto this is that many college graduates\\n leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is \\nthat we are the thin edge\\n(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of \\nthird-world wages and work practices coming\\n to North America.\\n\\nI worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they \\ncould maintain that (and prosper) just says\\n volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people \\nthere, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote\\nwith my feet. They didn\\'t quite realize that just about every large \\nemployer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway\\neventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired \\nemployees were brought in by the employer (rumours were\\nthat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of \\nrum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed\\n a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, \\nguess what - used to be a VP at the company.\\nThat\\'s free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - \\nas I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long\\nas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in \\nplace.\\n\\nAnd if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of \\nsome free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,\\nare going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received \\ngenerous subsidies, in return, I\\'m sure, for an understanding about\\nthe labor markets here.\\n\\n>\\n>BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\\n>*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\\n>all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\\n>there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\\n>most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\\n>*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\\n>all of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\\n>not \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\\n>\\n>That efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\\n>People\\'s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\\n>stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\\n>apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you\\'d\\n>know about it by now. In economic terms, it\\'s also called an increase\\n>in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I\\'m not talking about\\n>extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\\n>doesn\\'t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\\n>politician as Santa Claus come election time...\\n>  \\n>\\nMuch as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I \\nhave difficulty finding any - except of course for\\nlabor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well \\nunless the supply is tight)\\nIt was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the \\nself-made billionaires on\\nthe list, but now we\\'ve got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the \\nconcept of \"more stuff, cheaper\"\\nwhich it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly \\ngalling example is\\nhigh-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that \\nit is an area where the pricing\\napproaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the \\ntelecom industry (maintain your\\nmonopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through \\nthe same regulators) meet.\\nSadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole \\nentertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing\\nseems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer \\nseems less important than using\\nregulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to \\nproduce profits for the favored few.\\n\\n>\\n>In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\\n>theft, the rich don\\'t get rich off the backs of the poor, and\\n>redistributionist labor \"theory\" of value happy horseshit is just\\n>that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\\n>\\n>To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\\n>wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\\n>  \\n>\\nI usually agree - but when there\\'s a Republican in office -  I feel like \\nthey\\'re the biggest believers in\\nthe Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the \\nrights of that \"proletariat\" you\\'ve\\njust created with bogus \"law and order\" policies , concentrate capital \\nin the hands of a few (ideally people\\nwho can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, \\nand lie - use\\nthe word \"compassionate\" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain \\namount of poverty reduction actually\\nhelps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the \\nRepublic party seems to be the more homeless under\\n each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.\\n\\nAnd the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining \\nstandards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,\\ngreater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the \\nwork force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right\\n to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining \\nstandards of living) is the reality.\\n\\nAgain to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - \\nthe CIA world factbook - on the US economy:\\n\\n\"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to \\nthe top 20% of households\"\\n\\nOwen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn\\'t existed they\\nwould have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their\\nfundamental opposition isn\\'t to a warmer earth, it is to industrial\\ncivilization.\\n\\nThe fact that the sattelites didn\\'t match what the global warming\\ntheorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the\\ntemperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have\\nbeen validated with a different means of measurement.\\n\\nRather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global\\nwarming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the\\n\"Medieval Warm Period\".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,\\nand it obvioiusly wasn\\'t caused by CO2.\\n\\nIn point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused\\nDIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn\\'t trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,\\nand if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have\\nyour warming theory.\\n\\nYet it would seem that the very stability of the earth\\'s climate over\\nlong periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback\\nloops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.\\n\\nMore water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more\\nclouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great\\ndeal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit\\nthey do clouds very poorly.\\n\\nA good link is:\\nhttp://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&CID=2051-\\n060302A\\n\\n\\n> -----Original Message-----\\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\\nJim\\n> Whitehead\\n> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM\\n> To: Robert Harley; fork@example.com\\n> Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming\\n> \\n> > Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote:\\n> > >and say hello to the cool:  Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause\\n> > some stir ...\\n> >\\n> > Of course not.

I dunno how many times I\\'ve seen Xi \\ncome home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something \\nthat happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It\\'s a \\nbig problem to tackle, and I don\\'t know the answer.

If all is well you\\'ve got ALSA working! (\"dmesg\" to\\ncheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with\\ne.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.\\n\\nWith \"aplay\" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You\\ncan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...\\nhmmm, but maybe it\\'s another plugin) to listen to your good ol\\' mp3\\nfiles... that\\'s it!\\n\\nIt really isn\\'t complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only\\nthing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can\\'t\\nimagine myself doing that ;-) I\\'ve repackaged everything cleanly. Even the\\n/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly\\n%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d\\nstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the\\ndefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I\\'ve split alsa-lib\\'s\\ndevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static\\nlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against\\nwhich the \"alsa-driver\" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the\\nrpm release, so does the architecture!).\\n\\nI\\'m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!\\n\\nDownload :\\nhttp://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/\\n\\nCurrent spec files :\\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec\\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec\\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec\\n(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )\\n\\nMatthias\\n\\nPS: As an extra bonus, I\\'ve also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply\\nrun \"xine -A alsa09\" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)\\n\\n-- \\nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10\\nLoad : 0.57 0.42 0.42, AC on-line, battery charging: 29% (1:55)\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\\n\\n',\n",

The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of \\nIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in \\nthe article.\\n\\nOf course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic \\ncosts real money.

For the country\\'s fast-growing population of \\nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving \\nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked \\naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China\\x97apparently \\nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to \\nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been \\nrestored.\\n\\nAn unusual climbdown by China\\'s zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More \\nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to \\nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. \\nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by \\nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for \\nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\\n\\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users \\nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. \\nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet \\nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site \\nto far less powerful search engines in China.\\n\\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, \\nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to \\ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking \\nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be \\nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key \\nwords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this \\nweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on \\nGoogle for Falun Gong\\x97a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China\\x97\\nusually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search \\nalso rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I have to \\nadmit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, \"Do you \\nreally agree with mpt\\'s Top 10 list? He\\'s quoted you at the top of the list!\"\\n\\nDo I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of \\ncourse not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in \\nmind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily \\nagreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas \\nregarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is \\nan issue that needs to be addressed. That\\'s something.\\n\\nTo cover the list specifically:\\n\\n\\n- Navigator chrome structure - While I don\\'t necessarily agree with mpt\\'s \\nproposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is \\npainfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in \\norder for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.\\n\\n- Speed - can\\'t argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the \\nuseless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain \\nspeed.\\n\\n- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you\\'ll see that the textfield \\nwidget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It\\'s buggy, \\nslow, misbehaves, and doesn\\'t edit the way you\\'d expect. This is IMO Chimera\\'s \\ntop usability problem.\\n\\n- Message display - Yes. No argument here.\\n\\n- Search - Yeah, it\\'s a mess. Don\\'t know if it would be in my top ten, but it\\'s \\na mess.\\n\\n- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be \\nseparated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with \\nmultiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., \\nyou can eliminate the New submenu easily).\\n\\n- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.\\n\\n- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS \\ndefault on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. \\nIf you don\\'t like it, complain about Win32, but don\\'t cite this as a Mozilla \\nusability problem when we\\'re following the conventions of the operating system. \\n(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 \\nwants to fire it.)\\n\\n- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is \\ncompletely irrelevant.\\n\\n- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a \\ntangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique \\ndialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly \\nhalf the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously \\noverconfigurable.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641\\n[2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This is the\\ncurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2\\nconcentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth\\nshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may\\nbe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide.

Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\\'s team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \\n2001, DataPower\\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99), the \\nindustry\\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n\\nToday, XG3\\x99 technology powers the industry\\'s first wire-speed XML \\nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\nServices.

DataPower\\x92s solutions are based on \\nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99) technology.\\n\\n\"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \\nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \\nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \\nDataPower\\x92s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \\nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \\napplications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \\nTechnology.\\n\\n\"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that\\x92s critical to Web \\nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance.\" A single \\nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \\nservers\\x97breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \\nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \\naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \\nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \\ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \\nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\\n\\n\"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \\nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower\\x92s patent-pending technology addresses \\na very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael \\nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with \\nDataPower\\x92s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \\nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \\nperformance and security pitfalls.\"\\n\\n\"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly \\ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \\nsecurity,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \"DataPower is on \\ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \\nGeneration Three (XG3)\\xa0technology was quite simply the single most \\ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date.\"\\n\\n\"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \\nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \\ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \\nservices,\" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. \"DataPower\\x92s \\nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely \\non XML for mission critical applications.\"\\n\\nAbout Venrock Associates\\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \\nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \\nthat now spans over seven decades.

Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica\\n had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. \\n \\n Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made\\n it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in\\n October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: \"The\\n penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a\\n successful breeding season over the winter.\" \\n \\n Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall\\n and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research\\n station.

Somehow, I can\\'t imagine them removing the ability to\\nrun C programs.\\n\\n\\n>2.

Depends\\nentirely on the programmer, not the language.\\n\\n\\n>3.  Java is not just a programming language! It\\'s also a platform...\\n\\nBuzzword.\\n\\n\\n>a monolithic set of API\\'s or a crap load of different API\\'s slicing\\n>and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?\\n\\nUnsupported assertion.\\n\\n\\n>4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you\\n>can\\'t possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within\\n>the same magnitude of cost as Java....\\n\\nDunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC\\nin a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be\\n10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable\\nlibraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.\\nAt least that is the case when then language you used is available on\\nthe target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.\\n\\n\\n>5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a\\n>person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the\\n>individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is\\n>to reverse engineer C (large applications).\\n\\nYou can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get\\nsome kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for\\nmaintenance headaches ad infinitum.\\n\\n \\n>6.  Hardware is getting so fast that I\\'m not sure if the performance\\n>difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.\\n\\nWhoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I\\'m taking\\ntime out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could\\nwait 5 years until everyone\\'s PC is fast enough to generate random EC\\'s\\nin no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code\\nthat is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,\\nor I can do it now when very few people can.\\n\\n \\n>The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n\\n>And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others\\n>allow you to think more high level than low level.

What you seemed to\\nshow is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so\\nhelped (the \"after\" numbers are better than the \"before\" numbers, right?).\\nAssuming that what you did was override what\\'s now\\ntokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn\\'t\\ncall the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you\\'re missing\\ncarefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many\\ndozens of other header fields.  There\\'s no question that adding more header\\nfields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn\\'t do so only\\nbecause my testing corpora are such that I can\\'t add more headers without\\ngetting major benefits for bogus reasons.\\n\\nApart from all that, you said you\\'re skipping Received.

The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. \\n- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the \\nbrightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to \\nyesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? \\nToday's newzzz... Never mind. \\n- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a \\nFOAF file from an RSS feed. \\n- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward \\ncompatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. \\n- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such \\nas RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. \\n- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to \\naccomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing \\nlist[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. \\n- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is \\nthat unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both \\nusers.&#8221; \\n- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release \\nfor a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. \\n- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to \\nmaking a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to \\ngive it more stability.
